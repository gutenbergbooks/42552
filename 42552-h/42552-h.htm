<p><span class="bold">MARS,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> in astronomy, the fourth planet in the order of distance
from the sun, and the next outside the earth. To the naked
eye it appears as a bright star of a decidedly reddish or lurid
tint, which contrasts strongly with the whiteness of Venus
and Jupiter. At opposition it is brighter than a first magnitude
star, sometimes outshining even Sirius. It is by virtue of
its position the most favourably situated of all the planets
for observation from the earth. The eccentricity of its orbit,
0.0933, is greater than that of any other major planet except
Mercury. The result is that at an opposition near perihelion
Mars is markedly nearer to the earth than at an opposition
near aphelion, the one distance being about 35 million miles;
the other 63 million. These numbers express only the minimum
distances at or near opposition, and not the distance at other
times. The time of revolution of Mars is 686.98 days. The
mean interval between oppositions is 2 years 49½ days, but,
owing to the eccentricity of the orbit, the actual excess over
two years ranges from 36 days to more than 2½ months. Its
period of rotation is 24 h. 37 m. 22.66 s. (H. G. Bakhuyzen).</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Orbits of Mars and the Earth, showing aspects of the
planet relative to the earth and sun.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Motions.</i>&mdash;The accompanying diagram will convey a notion
of the varied aspects presented by the planet, of the cycles of
change through which they go, and of the order in which the
oppositions follow each other. The outer circle represents
the orbit of Mars, the inner one that of the earth. AE is the
line of the equinoxes from which longitudes are counted. The
perihelion of Mars is in longitude 335° at the point &pi;. The ascending
node &Omega; is in longitude 47°. The line of nodes makes
an angle of 74° with the major axis, so that Mars is south of
the ecliptic near perihelion, but north of it near aphelion.
Around the inner circle, representing the earth&rsquo;s orbit, are marked
the months during which the earth passes through the different
parts of the orbit. It will be seen that the distance of Mars
at the time of any opposition depends upon the month in which
opposition occurs. The least possible distance would occur
in an opposition about the end of August, a little before Mars
reached the perihelion, because the eccentricity of the earth&rsquo;s
orbit throws our planet a little farther from the sun and nearer
the orbit of Mars in July than it does in August. The opposition
of 1909 occurred on the 24th of September, at a point marked
by the year near the equinox, and the month and years of the
oppositions following, up to 1941, are also shown in the same
way. Tracing them around, it will be seen that the points
of opposition travel around the orbit in about 16 years, so
that oppositions near perihelion, when Mars is therefore nearest
the earth, occur at intervals of 15 or 17 years.</p>

<p>The axis of rotation of the planet is inclined between 23°
and 24° to the orbit, and the equator of the planet has the same
inclination to the plane of the orbit. The north pole is directed
toward a point in longitude 355°, in consequence of which the
projection of the planet&rsquo;s axis upon the plane of the ecliptic
is nearly parallel to the line of our equinoxes. This projection
is shown by the dotted line SP-NP, which corresponds closely
to the line of the Martian solstices. It will be seen that at a
September opposition the north pole of the planet is turned
away from the sun, so that only the southern hemisphere is
presented to us, and only the south pole can be seen from the
earth. The Martian vernal equinox is near Q and the northern
solstice near A. Here at the point S.P. the northern hemisphere
is turned toward the sun. It will be seen that the aspect of
the planet at opposition, especially the hemisphere which is
visible, varies with the month of opposition, the general rule
being that the northern hemisphere of the planet is entirely
seen only near aphelion oppositions, and therefore when farthest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page762" id="page762"></a>762</span>
from us, while the southern hemisphere is best seen near
perihelion oppositions. The distances of the planet from the
sun at aphelion and at perihelion are nearly in the ratio 6:5.
The intensity of the sun&rsquo;s radiation on the planet is as the
inverse square of this ratio. It is therefore more than 40%
greater near perihelion than near aphelion. It follows from
all this that the southern hemisphere is subjected to a more
intense solar heat than the northern, and must therefore have
a warmer summer season. But the length of the seasons is the
inverse of this, the summer of the northern hemisphere being
longer and the heat of the southern hemisphere shorter in
proportion.</p>

<p><i>Surface Features.</i>&mdash;The surface features of the planet will
be better understood by first considering what is known of
its atmosphere and of the temperature which probably prevails
on its surface. One method of detecting an atmosphere is
through its absorption of the different rays in the spectrum
of the sunlight reflected from the planet. Several observers
have thought that they saw fairly distinct evidence of such
absorption when the planet was examined with the spectroscope.
But the observations were not conclusive; and with the view
of setting the question at rest if possible, W. W. Campbell
at the Lick Observatory instituted a very careful series of
spectroscopic observations.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> To reduce the chances of error
to a minimum the spectrum of Mars was compared with that
of the moon when the two bodies were near each other. Not
the slightest difference could be seen between any of the lines
in the two spectra. It being certain that the spectrum of
the moon is not affected by absorption, it followed that any
absorption produced by the atmosphere of Mars is below the
limit of perception. It was considered by Campbell that if
the atmosphere of Mars were ¼ that of the earth in density,
the absorption would have been visible. Consequently the
atmosphere of Mars would be of a density less than ¼ that of
the earth.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>Closely related to the question of an atmosphere is that
of possible clouds above the surface of the planet, the existence
of which, if real, would necessarily imply an atmosphere of a
density approaching the limit set by Campbell&rsquo;s observations.
The most favourable opportunity for seeing clouds would be
when they are formed above a region of the planet upon which
the sun is about to rise, or from which it has just been setting.
The cloud will then be illuminated by the sun&rsquo;s rays while the
surface below it is in darkness, and will appear to an observer on
the earth as a spot of light outside the terminator, or visible edge
of the illuminated part of the disk. It is noticeable that phenomena
more or less of this character, though by no means
common, have been noted by observers on several occasions.
Among these have been the Mt Hamilton and Lowell observers,
and W. H. Pickering at Arequipa. Campbell has shown that
many of them may be accounted for by supposing the presence
of mountains not more than two miles in height, which may
well exist on the planet. While this hypothesis will serve
to explain several of these appearances, this can scarcely be
said of a detached spot observed on the evening of the 26th
of May 1903, at the Lowell Observatory.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Dr Slipher, who
first saw it, was so struck by the appearance of the projection
from the terminator upon the dark side of the disk that he
called the other observers to witness it. Micrometric measures
showed that it was some 300 miles in length, and that its highest
point stood some 17 miles above the surface of the planet.
That a cloud should be formed at such a height in so rare an
atmosphere seems difficult to account for except on the principle
that the rate of diminution of the density of an atmosphere
with its height is proportional to the intensity of gravity,
which is smaller on Mars than on the earth. The colour was
not white, but tawny, of the tint exhibited by a cloud of dust.
Percival Lowell therefore suggests that this and other appearances
of the same kind seen from time to time are probably
dust clouds, travelling over the desert, as they sometimes do on
the earth, and settling slowly again to the ground.</p>

<p><i>Temperature.</i>&mdash;Up to a recent time all that could be said
of the probable temperature of Mars was that, being more
distant from the sun than the earth, and having a rarer atmosphere,
it had a general mean temperature probably below that
of the earth. Greater precision can now be given to this
theoretical conclusion by recent determination of the law of
radiation of heat by bodies at different temperatures. Regarding
it as fairly well established that at ordinary temperatures
the radiation varies directly as the fourth power of the absolute
temperature, it is possible when the &ldquo;solar constant&rdquo; is known
to compute the temperature of a non-coloured body at the
distance of Mars which presents every part of its surface in
rapid succession to the sun&rsquo;s rays in the absence of atmosphere
only. This has been elaborately done for the major planets
by J. H. Poynting,<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> who computes that the mean temperature
of Mars is far below the freezing point of water. On the other
hand an investigation made by Lowell in 1907,<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> taking into
account the effect of the rare atmosphere on the heat lost by
reflection, and of several other factors in the problem hitherto
overlooked, led him to the conclusion that the mean temperature
is about 48° Fahr.<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> But the temperature may rise much
above the mean on those regions of the surface exposed to a
nearly vertical noon-day sun. The diurnal changes of temperature,
being diminished by an atmosphere, must be greater
on Mars than on the earth, so that the vicissitudes of temperature
are there very great, but cannot be exactly determined, because
they must depend upon the conductivity and thermal capacity
of the matter composing the surface of the planet. What we
can say with confidence is that, during the Martian winter of
between eight and twelve of our months, the regions around
either pole must fall to a temperature nearer the absolute zero
than any known on this planet. In fact the climatic conditions
in all but the equatorial regions are probably of the same nature
as those which prevail on the tops of our highest mountains,
except that the cold is more intense.<a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>Having these preliminary considerations in mind, we may
now study the features presented to our view by the surface
of the planet. These have a permanence and invariability
which markedly differentiate them from the ever varying
surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn, and show that what we see is
a solid surface, like that of our earth. They were observed
and delineated by the leading astronomers of the 16th century,
especially Huygens, Cassini and Hooke. These observers
could only distinguish the different regions upon the planet
as bright or dark. Reasoning as they did in the case of the
moon, it was naturally supposed that the brighter regions
were land and the darker ones seas. The observers of our time
find that the darker regions have a slightly blue-green aspect,
which might suggest the idea of water, but are variegated in
a way to show that they must be composed of a solid crust,
like the brighter regions. The latter have a decidedly warm
red or ochre tint, which gives the characteristic colour to the
planet as seen by the naked eye. The regions in equatorial
and middle latitudes, which are those best seen from our planet,
show a surface of which the general aspect is not dissimilar
to that which would be presented by the deserts of our earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page763" id="page763"></a>763</span>
when seen from the moon. With each improvement in the
telescope the numerous drawings of the planet show more
definiteness and certainty in details. About 1830 a fairly
good map was made by W. Beer and J. H. Mädler, a work
which has been repeated by a number of observers since that
time. The volume of literature on the subject, illustrated by
drawings and maps, has become so great that it is impossible
here to present even an abstract of it; and it would not be
practicable, even were it instructive, to enter upon any detailed
description of Martian topography. A few great and well-marked
features were depicted by the earliest observers, who
saw them so plainly that they may be recognized by their
drawings at the present time. There is also a general agreement
among nearly all observers with good instruments as to the
general features of the planet, but even in the latest drawings
there is a marked divergence as to the minuter details. This
is especially true of the boundaries of the more ill-defined
regions, and of the faint and difficult markings of various kinds
which are very numerous on every part of the planet. There
is not even a close agreement between the drawings by the
same observer at different oppositions; but this may be largely
due to seasonal and other changes.</p>

<p>The most striking feature, and one which shows the greatest
resemblance to a familiar terrestrial process, is that when
either polar region comes into view after being turned nearly
a year away from the sun, it is found to be covered with a white
cap. This gradually contracts in extent as the sun shines
upon it during the remaining half of the Martian year, sometimes
nearly disappearing. That this change is due to the precipitation
of watery vapour in the form of ice, snow or frost
during the winter, and its melting or evaporation when exposed
to the sun&rsquo;s rays, is so obvious a conclusion that it has never
been seriously questioned. It has indeed been suggested that
the deposit may be frozen carbonic acid. While we cannot
pronounce this out of the question, the probabilities seem in
favour of the deposit being due to the precipitation of aqueous
vapour in a frozen form. At a temperature of &minus;50° C., which
is far above what we can suppose to prevail in the polar regions
during the winter, the tension of aqueous vapour is 0.034 mm.
On the other hand Faraday found the tension of carbonic acid
to be still an entire atmosphere at as low a temperature as
&minus;80° C. Numerically exact statements are impossible owing
to our want of knowledge of the actual temperature, which
must depend partly upon air currents between the equator
and the poles of Mars. It can, however, be said, in a general
way, that a proportion of aqueous vapour in the rare atmosphere
of Mars, far smaller than that which prevails on the earth,
would suffice to explain the observed formation and disappearances
of the polar caps. Since every improvement in the
telescope and in the conditions of observation must enable
modern observers to see all that their predecessors did and yet
more, we shall confine our statements to the latest results.
These may be derived from the work of Professor Lowell of
Boston, who in 1894 founded an observatory at Flagstaff,
Arizona, 7250 ft. above sea-level, and supplied it with a 24&Prime;
telescope, of which the main purpose was the study of Mars.
This work has been continued with such care and assiduity
that its results must take precedence of all others in everything
that relates to our present subject.<a name="fa8a" id="fa8a" href="#ft8a"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>Among the more probable conclusions to be drawn from
Lowell&rsquo;s observations, the following are of most interest. The
darker areas are all seamed by lines and dots darker than themselves,
which are permanent in position, so that there can be
no bodies of water on the planet. On the other hand, their
colour, blue-green, is that of vegetation. This fades out as
vegetation would at certain seasons to faint blue-green, but
in some places to a tawny brown. Each hemisphere undergoes
these changes in its turn, the changes being opposite in opposite
hemispheres. The changes in the dark areas follow some
time after the melting of the polar caps. The aspect of these
areas suggests old sea bottoms, and when on the terminator
appear as depressions, though this may be only apparent and
due to the dark colour. The smoothness and soft outline
of the terminator shows that there are no mountains on Mars
comparable with ours, but that the surface is surprisingly flat.
White spots are occasionally visible in the tropical and temperate
regions, which are perhaps due to the condensation of frost
or snow, or to saline exudation such as seasonally occurs in
India (Lowell). Moreover in winter the temperate zones
are more or less covered by a whitish veil, which may be either
hoar frost or cloud. A spring haze seems to surround the
north polar cap during its most extensive melting; otherwise
the Martian sky is quite clear, like that of a dry desert land.
When either polar cap is melting it is bordered by a bluish
area, which Lowell attributes to the water produced by the
melting. But the obliquity at which the sun&rsquo;s rays strike
the surface as the cap is melting away is so great that it would
seem to preclude the possibility of a temperature high enough
to melt the snow into water. Under the low barometric pressure
prevailing on the planet, snow would evaporate under the
influence of the sun&rsquo;s rays without changing into water. It
is also contended that what looks like such a bluish border
may be formed around a bright area by the secondary aberration
of a refracting telescope.<a name="fa9a" id="fa9a" href="#ft9a"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>The modern studies of Mars which have aroused so much
public interest began with the work of Schiaparelli in 1877.
Accepting the term &ldquo;ocean,&rdquo; used by the older observers,
to designate the widely extended darker regions on the planet,
and holding that they were really bodies of water, he found
that they were connected by comparatively narrow streaks.
(Schiaparelli considered them really water until after the Lowell
observations.) In accordance with the adopted system of
nomenclature, he termed these streaks <i>canale</i>, a word of which
the proper rendering into English would be <i>channels</i>. But
the word was actually translated into both English and French
as canal, thus connoting artificiality in the supposed waterways,
which were attributed to the inhabitants of the planet. The
fact that they were many miles in breadth, and that it was
therefore absurd to call them canals, did not prevent this term
from being so extensively used that it is now scarcely possible
to do away with it. A second series of observations was made
by Schiaparelli at the opposition of 1879, when the planet was
farther away, but was better situated as to altitude above
the horizon. He now found a number of additional channels,
which were much finer than those he had previously drawn.
The great interest attaching to their seemingly artificial character
gave an impetus to telescopic study of the planet which has
continued to the present time. New canals were added, especially
at the Lowell Observatory, until the entire number listed
in 1908 amounted to more than 585. The general character
of this complex system of lines is described by Lowell as a
network covering the whole face of the planet, light and dark
regions alike, and connecting at either end with the respective
polar caps there. At their junctions are small dark pinheads
of spots. The lines vary in size between themselves, but each
maintains its own width throughout. But the more difficult
of these objects are only seen occasionally and are variable
in definiteness. Of two canals equally well situated for seeing,
only one may be visible at one time and only the other at
other times. If this variability of aspect among different
canals is true as they are seen from the Lowell Observatory,
we find it true to a much greater extent when we compare
descriptions by different observers. At Flagstaff, the most
favourably situated of all the points of observation, they are
seen as fine sharp lines, sometimes as well marked as if drawn
with a pencil. But other observers see them with varying
degrees of breadth and diffuseness.</p>

<p>One remarkable feature of these objects is their occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page764" id="page764"></a>764</span>
&ldquo;gemination,&rdquo; some of the canals appearing as if doubled.
This was first noticed by Schiaparelli, and has been confirmed,
so far as observations can confirm it, by other observers. Different
explanations of this phenomenon have been suggested,
but the descriptions of it are not sufficiently definite to render
any explanation worthy of entire confidence possible. Indeed
the more cautious astronomers, who have not specially devoted
themselves to the particular phenomena, reserve a doubt
as to how far the apparent phenomena of the finer canals are
real, and what the markings which give rise to their appearance
might prove to be if a better and nearer view of the planet
than is now possible could be obtained. Of the reality of the
better marked ones there can be no doubt, as they have been
seen repeatedly by many observers, including those at the
Lick Observatory, and have actually been photographed at
the Lowell Observatory. The doubt is therefore confined
to the vast network of lines so fine that they never certainly
have been seen elsewhere than at Flagstaff. The difficulty
of pronouncing upon their reality arises from the fact that
we have to do mainly with objects not plainly visible (or, as
Lowell contends, not plainly visible elsewhere). The question
therefore becomes one of psychological optics rather than of
astronomy. When the question is considered from this point
of view it is found that combinations of light and shaded areas
very different from continuous lines, will, under certain conditions,
be interpreted by the eye as such lines; and when such
is the case, long practice by an observer, however carefully
conducted, may confirm him in this interpretation. To give
a single example of the principles involved; it is found by
experiment that if, through a long line so fine as to approach
the limit of visibility, segments not too near each other, or so
short that they would not be visible by themselves, be taken
out, their absence from the line will not be noticed, and the
latter will still seem continuous.<a name="fa10a" id="fa10a" href="#ft10a"><span class="sp">10</span></a> In other words we do not
change the aspect of the line by taking away from it a part
which by itself would be invisible. This act of the eye, in
interpreting a discontinuous series of very faint patches as a
continuous line, is not, properly speaking, an optical illusion,
but rather a habit. The arguments for the reality of all the
phenomena associated with the canals, while cogent, have not
sufficed to bring about a general consensus of opinion among
critics beyond the limit already mentioned.</p>

<p>Accepting the view that the dark lines on Mars are objectively
real and continuous, and are features as definite in reality as
they appear in the telescope, Professor Lowell has put forth an
explanation of sufficient interest to be mentioned here. His
first proposition is that lines frequently thousands of miles long,
each following closely a great circle, must be the product of
design rather than of natural causes. His explanation is that
they indicate the existence of irrigating canals which carry the
water produced annually by the melting of the polar snows to
every part of the planet. The actual canals are too minute to
be visible to us. What we really see as dark lines are broad
strips of vegetation, produced by artificial cultivation extending
along each border of the irrigating streams. On the other hand,
in the view of his critics, the quantity of ice or snow which the
sun&rsquo;s rays could melt around the poles of Mars, the rate of flow
and evaporation as the water is carried toward the equator,
and several other of the conditions involved, require investigation
before the theory can be established.<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p><i>Satellites and Pole of Mars.</i>&mdash;At the opposition of Mars which
occurred in August 1877 the planet was unusually near the earth.
Asaph Hall, then in charge of the 26&Prime; telescope at the Naval
Observatory in Washington, took advantage of this favourable
circumstance to make a careful search for a visible satellite of
the planet. On the night of the 11th of August he found a
faint object near the planet. Cloudy weather intervened, and
the object was not again seen until the 16th, when it was found
to be moving with the planet, leaving no doubt as to its being
a satellite. On the night following an inner satellite much nearer
the planet was observed. This discovery, apart from its intrinsic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page765" id="page765"></a>765</span>
interest, is also noteworthy as the first of a series of discoveries
of satellites of the outer planets. The satellites of Mars are
difficult to observe, on account not merely of their faintness, but
of their proximity to the planet, the light of which is so bright
as to nearly blot out that of the satellite. Intrinsically the inner
satellite is brighter than the outer one, but for the reason just
mentioned it is more difficult to observe. The names given them
by Hall were Deimos for the outer satellite and Phobos for the
inner one, derived from the mythological horses that drew the
chariot of the god Mars. A remarkable feature of the orbit
of Phobos is that it is so near the planet as to perform a revolution
in less than one-third that of the diurnal rotation of Mars.
The result is that to an inhabitant of Mars this satellite would
rise in the west and set in the east, making two apparent diurnal
revolutions every day. The period of Deimos is only six days
greater than that of a Martian day; consequently its apparent
motion around the planet would be so slow that more than two
days elapse between rising and setting, and again between
setting and rising.</p>

<p>Owing to the minuteness of these bodies it is impossible to
make any measures of their diameters. These can be inferred
only from their brightness. Assuming them to be of the same
colour as Mars, Lowell estimates them to be about ten miles for
Deimos and somewhat more for Phobos. But these estimates
are uncertain, not only from the somewhat hypothetical character
of the data on which they rest, but from the difficulty of accurately
estimating the brightness of such an object in the glare
of the planet.</p>

<p>A long and careful series of observations was made upon these
bodies by other observers. Later, especially at the very favourable
oppositions of 1892 and 1894, observations were made by
Hermann Struve at Poulkova, who subjected all the observations
up to 1898 to a very careful discussion. He showed that
the inclination of the planes of the orbits to the equator of the
planet is quite small, thus making it certain that these two planes
can never wander far from each other. In the following statement
of the numerical elements of the entire system, Struve&rsquo;s
results are given for the satellites, while those of Lowell are
adopted for the position of the plane of the equator.</p>

<p>The relations of the several planes can be best conceived by
considering the points at which lines perpendicular to them, or
their poles, meet the celestial sphere. By theory, the pole of
the orbital plane of each satellite revolves round the pole of a
certain fixed plane, differing less from the plane of the equator
of Mars the nearer the satellite is to Mars. Lowell from a combination
of his own observations with those of Schiaparelli, Lohse
and Cerulli, found for the pole of the axis of rotation of Mars<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a>:&mdash;</p>

Struve, from the observations of the satellites, found
theoretically the following positions of this pole, and of those of
the fixed planes of the satellite orbits for 1900:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;Flammarion, <i>La Planète Mars et ses conditions
d&rsquo;habitilité</i> (Paris, 1892), embodies so copious a <i>résumé</i> of all the
publications and drawings relating to Mars up to 1891 that there is
little occasion for reference in detail to early publications. Among
the principal sources may be mentioned the <i>Monthly Notices</i> and
<i>Memoirs</i> of the Royal Astronomical Society, the publications of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific, especially vols. vi., viii. and ix.,
containing observations and discussions by the Mt Hamilton
astronomers, and the journals, <i>Sidereal Messenger, Astronomy</i> and
<i>Astrophysics</i> and <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>. Schiaparelli&rsquo;s extended
memoirs appeared under the general title <i>Osservazioni astronomiche
e fisiche sull&rsquo; asse di rotazione e sulla topografia del pianeta Marte</i>,
and were published in different volumes of the <i>Memoirs</i> of the <i>Reale
Accademia dei Lincei</i> of Rome. The observations and drawings of
Lowell are found <i>in extenso</i> in <i>Annals</i> of the Lowell Observatory.
Lowell&rsquo;s conclusions are summarized in <i>Mars and its Canals</i>, by
Percival Lowell (1906), and <i>Mars as the Abode of Life</i> (1909). In
connexion with his work may be mentioned <i>Mars and its Mystery</i>,
by Edward S. Morse (Boston, 1906), the work of a naturalist who
made studies of the planet at the Lowell Observatory in 1905.
Brief discussions and notices will also be found in the Lowell Observatory
<i>Bulletins</i>. The optical principles involved in the interpretations
of the canals are discussed in recent volumes of the <i>Monthly
Notices, R.A.S</i>., and in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>. In 1907 the
veteran A. R. Wallace disputed Lowell&rsquo;s views vigorously in his
<i>Is Mars Habitable?</i> and was briefly answered by Lowell in <i>Nature</i>,
who contended that Wallace&rsquo;s theory was not in accord with celestial
mechanics.</p>

spectrum far into the red. Comparison spectrograms of Mars and
the Moon, taken by him at equal altitudes on such plates, eight in
all, show the &ldquo;a&rdquo; band, the great band of water-vapour was
distinctly stronger in the spectrum of Mars, thus affording what
appeared decisive evidence of water vapour in the atmosphere of
the planet.</p>

<p><a name="ft11a" id="ft11a" href="#fa11a"><span class="fn">11</span></a> Prof. Lowell&rsquo;s theory is supported by so much evidence of different
kinds that his own exposition should be read <i>in extenso</i> in <i>Mars
and its canals</i> and <i>Mars as the abode of life</i>. In order, however,
that his views may be adequately presented here, he has kindly
supplied the following summary in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owing to inadequate atmospheric advantages generally, much
misapprehension exists as to the definiteness with which the surface
of Mars is seen under good conditions. In steady air the canals
are perfectly distinct lines, not unlike the Fraunhofer ones of the
Spectrum, pencil lines or gossamer filaments according to size. All
the observers at Flagstaff concur in this. The photographs of them
taken there also confirm it up to the limit of their ability. Careful
experiments by the same observers on artificial lines show that if
the canals had breaks amounting to 16 m. across, such breaks would
be visible. None are; while the lines themselves are thousands of
miles long and perfectly straight (<i>Astrophys. Journ.</i>, Sept. 1907).
Between expert observers representing the planet at the same epoch
the accordance is striking; differences in drawings are differences
of time and are due to seasonal and secular changes in the planet
itself. These seasonal changes have been carefully followed at
Flagstaff, and the law governing them detected. They are found to
depend upon the melting of the polar caps. After the melting is
under way the canals next the cap proceed to darken, and the darkening
thence progresses regularly down the latitudes. Twice this
happens every Martian year, first from one cap and then six Martian
months later from the other. The action reminds one of the quickening
of the Nile valley after the melting of the snows in Abyssinia;
only with planet-wide rhythm. Some of the canals are paired.
The phenomenon is peculiar to certain canals, for only about one-tenth
of the whole number, 56 out of 585, ever show double and these
do so regularly. Each double has its special width; this width
between the pair being 400 m. in some cases, only 75 in others. Careful
plotting has disclosed the fact that the doubles cluster round the
planet&rsquo;s equator, rarely pass 40° Lat., and never occur at the poles,
though the planet&rsquo;s axial tilt reveals all its latitudes to us in turn.
They are thus features of those latitudes where the surface is greatest
compared with the area of the polar cap, which is suggestive. Space
precludes mention of many other equally striking peculiarities of
the canals&rsquo; positioning and development. At the junctions of the
canals are small, dark round spots, which also wax and wane with
the seasons. These facts and a host of others of like significance have
led Lowell to the conclusion that the whole canal system is of artificial
origin, first because of each appearance and secondly because of
the laws governing its development. Every opposition has added
to the assurance that the canals are artificial; both by disclosing
their peculiarities better and better and by removing generic doubts
as to the planet&rsquo;s habitability. The warmer temperature disclosed
from Lowell&rsquo;s investigation on the subject, and the spectrographic
detection by Slipher of water-vapour in the Martian air, are among
the latest of these confirmations.&rdquo;&mdash;[<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSALA,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> a seaport of Sicily, in the province of Trapani,
19 m. by rail S. of Trapani. Pop. (1881), 19,732; (1901), 57,567.
The low coast on which it is situated is the westernmost point of
the island. The town is the seat of a bishop, and the cathedral
contains 16 grey marble columns, which are said to have been
intended for Canterbury Cathedral in England, the vessel
conveying them having been wrecked here. The town owes its
importance mainly to the trade in Marsala wine.</p>

<p>Marsala occupies the site of <i>Lilybaeum</i>, the principal stronghold
of the Carthaginians in Sicily, founded by Himilco after the
abandonment of <i>Motya</i>. Neither Pyrrhus nor the Romans were
able to reduce it by siege, but it was surrendered to the latter in
241 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> at the end of the First Punic War. In the later wars it
was a starting point for the Roman expeditions against Carthage;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page766" id="page766"></a>766</span>
and under Roman rule it enjoyed considerable prosperity (<i>C.I.L.</i>
x. p. 742). It obtained municipal rights from Augustus and
became a colony under Pertinax or Septimus Severus. The
Saracens gave it its present name, <i>Marsa Ali</i>, port of Ali. The
harbour, which lay on the north-east, was destroyed by Charles
V. to prevent its occupation by pirates. The modern harbour
lies to the south-east. In 1860 Garibaldi landed at Marsala
with 1000 men and began his campaign in Sicily. Scanty
remains of the ancient <i>Lilybaeum</i> (fragments of the city walls,
of squared stones, and some foundations of buildings between
the walls and the sea) are visible; and the so-called grotto and
spring of the Sibyl may be mentioned. To the east of the town
is a great fosse which defended it on the land side, and beyond
this again are quarries like those of Syracuse on a small scale.
The modern town takes the shape of the Roman camp within
the earlier city, one of the gates of which still existed in 1887.
The main street (the Cassaro) perpetuates the name <i>castrum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSEILLES<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span>, a city of southern France, chief seaport of
France and of the Mediterranean, 219 m. S. by E. of Lyons and
534 m. S.S.E. of Paris, by the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railway.
Pop. (1906), commune 517,498; town 421,116. Marseilles is
situated on the Golfe du Lion on the eastern shore of a bay
protected to the south by Cape Croisette but open towards the
west; to the east the horizon is bounded by an amphitheatre
of hills, those in the foreground clothed with vegetation while
the more distant eminences are bare and rugged. The city is
built on undulating ground and the south-western and most
aristocratic quarter covers the slopes of the ridge crowned by a
fort and the church of Notre-Dame de la Garde and projecting
westward into the bay to form a protection for the harbour.
The newest and most pleasant portion lies on the south-eastern
slope of the ridge, between the southern end of the Rue Paradis
and the Prado avenues, which is better protected than most
other quarters from the mistral that blows down the Rhone
valley, and where in summer the temperature is always a little
lower than in the centre of the town. The old harbour of
Marseilles opens on the west to the Golfe du Lion, the famous
Rue Cannebière<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> prolonged by the Rue Noailles leading E.N.E.
from its inner end. These two streets are the centre of the life
of the city. Continued in the Allées de Meilhan and the Boulevard
de la Madeleine, they form one of its main arteries. The
other, at right angles with the first, connects the Place d&rsquo;Aix
with the spacious and fashionable Promenade du Prado, by
way of the Cours Belsunce and the Rue de Rome. Other fine
streets&mdash;the Rue St Ferréol, the Rue Paradis and the Rue
Breteuil are to the south of the Cannebière running parallel with
the Rue de Rome. To these must be added the neighbouring
avenue of Pierre Puget named after the sculptor whose statue
stands in the Borély Park. The Prado, with its avenues of
trees and fine houses, runs to within a quarter of a mile of the
Huveaune, a stream that borders the city on the south-east,
then turns off at right angles and extends to the sea, coming
to an end close to the Borély Park and the race-course. From
its extremity the Chemin de la Corniche runs northwards along
the coast, fringed by villas and bathing establishments, to the
Anse des Catalans, a distance of 4½ miles.</p>

<p>The old town of Marseilles is bounded W. by the Joliette basin
and the sea, E. by the Cours Belsunce, S. by the northern quay
of the old port, and N. by the Boulevard des Dames. It consists
of a labyrinth of steep, dark and narrow streets inhabited by
a seafaring population. Through its centre runs the broad Rue
de la République, extending from the Cannebière to the Place
de la Joliette. The entrance to the old harbour is defended by
Fort St Jean on the north and Fort St Nicolas on the south.
Behind the latter is the Anse (Creek) de la Réserve. Beyond
this again, situated in succession along the shore, come the
Château du Pharo, given by the empress Eugénie to the town,
the Anse du Pharo, the military exercising ground, and the Anse
des Catalans. To the old harbour, which covers only 70 acres
with a mean depth of 19½ ft. and is now used by sailing vessels,
the basin of La Joliette (55 acres) with an entrance harbour was
added in 1853. Communicating with the old harbour by a
channel which passes behind Fort St Jean, this dock opens on
the south into the outer harbour, opposite the palace and the
Anse du Pharo. A series of similar basins separated from the
roadstead by a jetty 2½ m. long was subsequently added along
the shore to the north, viz. the basins of Lazaret and Arenc,
bordered by the harbour railway station and the extensive warehouses
of the Compagnie des Docks et Entrepôts, the Bassin
de la Gare Maritime with the warehouses of the chamber of
commerce; the Bassin National with the refitting basin, comprising
six dry docks behind it; and the Bassin de la Pinède
entered from the northern outer harbour. These new docks
have a water area of 414 acres and over 11 m. of quays, and
are commodious and deep enough for the largest vessels to
man&oelig;uvre easily.</p>

<p>In the roads to the south-west of the port lie the islands of
Ratonneau and Pomègue, united by a jetty forming a quarantine
port. Between them and the mainland is the islet of Château
d&rsquo;If, in which the scene of part of Dumas&rsquo; <i>Monte Cristo</i> is
laid.</p>

<p>Marseilles possesses few remains of either the Greek or Roman
periods of occupation, and is poor in medieval buildings. The
old cathedral of la Major (Sainte-Marie-Majeure), dating chiefly
from the 12th century and built on the ruins of a temple of Diana,
is in bad preservation. The chapel of St Lazare (late 15th
century) in the left aisle is in the earliest Renaissance style, and a
bas-relief of white porcelain by Lucca della Robbia is of artistic
value. Beside this church and alongside the Joliette basin is a
modern building begun in 1852, opened for worship in 1893 and
recognized as the finest modern cathedral in France. It is a
Byzantine basilica, in the form of a Latin cross, 460 ft. long,
built in green Florentine stone blended with white stone from the
neighbourhood of Arles. The four towers which surmount it&mdash;two
at the west front, one over the crossing, one at the east end&mdash;are
roofed with cupolas. Near the cathedral stands the bishop&rsquo;s
palace, and the Place de la Major, which they overlook, is embellished
with the statue of Bishop Belsunce, who displayed great
devotion during the plague of 1720-1721. The celebrated Notre-Dame
de la Garde, the steeple of which, surmounted by a gilded
statue of the Virgin, 30 ft. in height, rises 150 ft. above the
summit of the hill on which it stands, commands a view of the
whole port and town, as well as of the surrounding mountains
and the neighbouring sea. The present chapel is modern and
occupies the site of one built in 1214.</p>

<p>On the south side of the old harbour near the Fort St Nicolas
stands the church of St Victor, built in the 13th century and once
attached to an abbey founded early in the 4th century. With
its lofty crenellated walls and square towers built of large blocks
of uncemented stone, it resembles a fortress. St Victor is built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page767" id="page767"></a>767</span>
above crypts dating mainly from the 11th century but also
embodying architecture of the Carolingian period and of the
early centuries of the Christian era. Tradition relates that St
Lazarus inhabited the catacombs under St Victor; and the black
image of the Virgin, still preserved there, is popularly attributed
to St Luke. The spire, which is the only relic of the ancient
church of Accoules, marks the centre of Old Marseilles. At its
foot are a &ldquo;calvary&rdquo; and a curious underground chapel in rock
work, both modern. Notre-Dame du Mont Carmel, also in the
old town, occupies the place of what was the citadel of the
Massaliots when they were besieged by Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>Of the civil buildings of the city, the prefecture, one of the
finest in France, the Palais de Justice, in front of which is the
statue of the advocate Antoine Berryer (1790-1868) and the
Exchange, all date from the latter half of the 19th century. The
Exchange, built at the expense of the Chamber of Commerce,
includes the spacious hall of that institution with its fine mural
paintings and gilding. The hôtel-de-ville (17th century) stands
on the northern quay of the old harbour. All these buildings
are surpassed by the Palais Longchamp (1862-1870), situated
in the north-east of the town at the end of the Boulevard Longchamp.
The centre of the building is occupied by a monumental
<i>château d&rsquo;eau</i> (reservoir). Colonnades branch off from this,
uniting it on the left to the picture gallery, with a fine collection
of ancient and modern works, and on the right to the natural
history museum, remarkable for its conchological department
and collection of ammonites. In front are ornamental grounds;
behind are extensive zoological gardens, with the astronomical
observatory. The museum of antiquities is established in the
Château Borély (1766-1778) in a fine park at the end of
the Prado. It includes a Phoenician collection (containing the
remains that support the hypothesis of the Phoenician origin
of Marseilles), an Egyptian collection, numerous Greek, Latin,
and Christian inscriptions in stone, &amp;c. A special building
within the city contains the school of art with a valuable library
and a collection of medals and coins annexed to it. The city
also has a colonial museum and a laboratory of marine zoology.
The triumphal arch of Aix, originally dedicated to the victors
of the Trocadéro, was in 1830 appropriated to the conquests of
the empire.</p>

<p>The canal de Marseille, constructed from 1837 to 1848, which
has metamorphosed the town and its arid surroundings by bringing
to them the waters of the Durance, leaves the river opposite
Pertuis. It has a length of 97 miles (including its four main
branches) of which 13 are underground, and irrigates some 7500
acres. After crossing the valley of the Arc, between Aix and
Rognac, by the magnificent aqueduct of Roquefavour, it purifies
its waters, charged with ooze, in the basins of Réaltort. It
draws about 2200 gallons of water per second from the Durance,
supplies 2450 horse-power to works in the vicinity of Marseilles,
and ensures a good water-supply and efficient sanitation to the
city.</p>

<p>Marseilles is the headquarters of the XV. army corps and the
seat of a bishop and a prefect. It has tribunals of first instance
and of commerce, a chamber of commerce, a board of trade
arbitration, and a branch of the Bank of France. The educational
institutions include a faculty of science, a school of
medicine and pharmacy, and a faculty (<i>faculté libre</i>) of law,
these three forming part of the university of Aix-Marseille;
lycées for boys and girls, a conservatoire of music, a school of
fine art, a higher school of commerce, a school for ships&rsquo; boys, a
school of navigation and industrial schools for both sexes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Trade and Industry.</i>&mdash;Marseilles is the western emporium for the
Levant trade and the French gate of the Far East. It suffers,
however, from the competition of Genoa, which is linked with the
Rhine basin by the Simplon and St Gotthard railway routes, and from
lack of communication with the inland waterways of France. In
January 1902 the chamber of deputies voted £3,656,000 for the construction
of a canal from Marseilles to the Rhone at Arles. This
scheme was designed to overcome the difficulties of egress from the
Rhone and to make the city the natural outlet of the rich Rhone
basin. Much of the activity of the port is due to the demand for
raw material created by the industries of Marseilles itself. The
imports include raw silk, sesame, ground-nuts and other oil-producing
fruits and seeds largely used in the soap manufacture, cereals and
flour, wool, hides and skins, olive and other oils, raw cotton, sheep
and other livestock, woven goods, table fruit, wine, potatoes and
dry vegetables, lead, cocoon silk, coffee, coal, timber. The total
value of imports was £64,189,000 in 1907, an increase of £18,000,000
in the preceding decade. The exports, of which the total value was
£52,901,000 (an increase of £21,000,000 in the decade) included
cotton fabrics, silk fabrics, cereals and flour, hides and skins, wool
fabrics, worked skins, olive and other oils, chemical products, wine,
refined sugar, raw cotton, wool, coal, building-material, machinery
and pottery.</p>

<p>The port is the centre for numerous lines of steamers, of which
the chief are the Messageries Maritimes, which ply to the eastern
Mediterranean, the east coast of Africa, Australia, India, Indo-China,
Havre and London, and the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique,
whose vessels run to Algiers, Tunis, Malta, Corsica, Morocco and the
Antilles. In addition many important foreign lines call at the port,
among them being the P. and O., the Orient, the North German
Lloyd, and the German East Africa lines.</p>

<p>Marseilles has five chief railway stations, two of which serve the
new harbours, while one is alongside the old port; the city is on the
main line of the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railway from the Riviera
and Toulon to Paris via Arles, Avignon and Lyons, another less
important line connecting it with Aix.</p>

<p>Soap-making, introduced in antiquity from Savona and Genoa,
is carried on in upwards of fifty factories. These utilize the products
of the oil-distilleries and of the chemical works, the latter being also
an important adjunct to the manufacture of candles, another leading
industry. A large quantity of iron, copper and other ores is smelted
in the blast-furnaces of Saint Louis in the vicinity and in other
foundries, and the Mediterranean Engineering Company and other
companies have large workshops for the construction or repair of
marine steam-engines and every branch of iron shipbuilding. To
these industries must be added flour-milling, the manufacture of
semolina and other farinaceous foods and of biscuits, bricks and
tiles, rope, casks, capsules for bottles and other tin-goods, tanning,
distilling, brewing and sulphur- and sugar-refining. There are state
tobacco and match factories.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The Greek colony of Massalia (Lat. <i>Massilia</i>) was
founded by the mariners of Phocaea in Asia Minor, about 600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
The settlement of the Greeks in waters which the Carthaginians
reserved for their own commerce was not effected without a naval
conflict; it is not improbable that the Phoenicians were settled
at Marseilles before the Greek period, and that the name of the
town is the Phoenician for &ldquo;settlement.&rdquo; Whether the judges
(<i>sophetim</i>, &ldquo;suffetes&rdquo;) of the Phoenician sacrificial tablet of
Marseilles were the rulers of a city existing before the advent of
the Phocaeans, or were consuls for Punic residents in the Greek
period, is disputed. In 542 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the fall of the Phocaean cities
before the Persians probably sent new settlers to the Ligurian
coast and cut off the remote city of Massalia from close connexion
with the mother country. Isolated amid alien populations, the
Massaliots made their way by prudence in dealing with the
inland tribes, by vigilant administration of their oligarchical
government, and by frugality united to remarkable commercial
and naval enterprise. Their colonies spread east and west
along the coast from Monaco to Cape St Martin in Spain,
carrying with them the worship of Artemis; the inland trade, in
which wine was an important element, can be traced by finds of
Massalian coins across Gaul and through the Alps as far as Tirol.
In the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the Massaliot Pytheas visited the coasts
of Gaul, Britain and Germany, and Euthymenes is said to have
sailed down the west coast of Africa as far as Senegal. The great
rival of Massalian trade was Carthage, and in the Punic Wars the
city took the side of Rome, and was rewarded by Roman assistance
in the subjugation of the native tribes of Liguria. In the war
between Caesar and Pompey Massilia took Pompey&rsquo;s side and in
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 49 offered a vain resistance to Caesar&rsquo;s lieutenant Trebonius.
In memory of its ancient services the city, &ldquo;without which,&rdquo;
as Cicero says, &ldquo;Rome had never triumphed over the Transalpine
nations,&rdquo; was left as a <i>civitas libera</i>, but her power was broken
and most of her dependencies taken from her. From this time
Massilia has little place in Roman history; it became for a time
an important school of letters and medicine, but its commercial
and intellectual importance declined. The town appears to
have been christianized before the end of the 3rd century, and
at the beginning of the 4th century was the scene of the martyrdom
of St Victor. Its reputation partly revived through the
names of Gennadius and Cassian, which give it prominence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page768" id="page768"></a>768</span>
in the history of Semi-Pelagianism and the foundation of western
monachism.</p>

<p>After the ravages of successive invaders, Marseilles was repeopled
in the 10th century under the protection of its viscounts.
The town gradually bought up their rights, and at the beginning
of the 13th century was formed into a republic, governed by a
<i>podestat</i>, who was appointed for life, and exercised his office in
conjunction with 3 notables, and a municipal council, composed of
80 citizens, 3 clerics, and 6 principal tradesmen. During the rest
of the middle ages, however, the higher town was governed by
the bishop, and had its harbour at the creek of La Joliette which
at that period ran inland to the north of the old town. The
southern suburb was governed by the abbot of St Victor, and
owned the Port des Catalans. Situated between the two, the
lower town, the republic, retained the old harbour, and was the
most powerful of the three divisions. The period of the crusades
brought prosperity to Marseilles, though throughout the middle
ages it suffered from the competition of Pisa, Genoa and Venice.
In 1245 and 1256 Charles of Anjou, count of Provence, whose
predecessors had left the citizens a large measure of independence,
established his authority above that of the republic. In 1423
Alphonso V. of Aragon sacked the town. King René, who had
made it his winter residence, however, caused trade, arts and
manufactures again to flourish. On the embodiment of Provence
in the kingdom of France in 1481, Marseilles preserved a separate
administration directed by royal officials. Under Francis I.
the disaffected constable Charles de Bourbon vainly besieged the
town with the imperial forces in 1524. During the wars of
religion, Marseilles took part against the Protestants, and long
refused to acknowledge Henry IV. The loss of the ancient
liberties of the town brought new disturbances under the Fronde,
which Louis XIV. came in person to suppress. He entered the
town by a breach in the walls and afterwards had Fort St Nicolas
constructed. Marseilles repeatedly suffered from the plague,
notably from May 1720 to May 1721.</p>

<p>During the Revolution the people rose against the aristocracy,
who up to that time had governed the commune. In the Terror
they rebelled against the Convention, but were promptly subdued
by General Carteaux. The wars of the empire, by dealing a
blow to their maritime commerce, excited the hatred of the
inhabitants against Napoleon, and they hailed the return of the
Bourbons and the defeat of Waterloo. The news of the latter
provoked a bloody reaction in the town against those suspected
of imperialism. The prosperity of the city received a considerable
impulse from the conquest of Algeria and from the opening of
the Suez Canal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSH, ADAM<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Adam de Marisco</span>) (d. <i>c.</i> 1258), English
Franciscan, scholar and theologian, was born about 1200 in the
diocese of Bath, and educated at Oxford under the famous
Grosseteste. Before 1226 Adam received the benefice of Wearmouth
from his uncle, Richard Marsh, bishop of Durham; but
between that year and 1230 he entered the Franciscan order.
About 1238 he became the lecturer of the Franciscan house at
Oxford, and within a few years was regarded by the English
province of that order as an intellectual and spiritual leader.
Roger Bacon, his pupil, speaks highly of his attainments in
theology and mathematics. His fame, however, rests upon the
influence which he exercised over the statesmen of his day.
Consulted as a friend by Grosseteste, as a spiritual director by
Simon de Montfort, the countess of Leicester and the queen,
as an expert lawyer and theologian by the primate, Boniface
of Savoy, he did much to guide the policy both of the opposition
and of the court party in all matters affecting the interests of
the Church. He shrank from office, and never became provincial
minister of the English Franciscans, though constantly charged
with responsible commissions. Henry III. and Archbishop
Boniface unsuccessfully endeavoured to secure for him the see of
Ely in 1256. In 1257 Adam&rsquo;s health was failing, and he appears
to have died in the following year. To judge from his correspondence
he took no interest in secular politics. He sympathized
with Montfort as with a friend of the Church and an unjustly
treated man; but on the eve of the baronial revolution he was
on friendly terms with the king. Faithful to the traditions of his
order, he made it his ambition to be a mediator. He rebuked
both parties in the state for their shortcomings, but he did not
break with either.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSH, GEORGE PERKINS<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (1801-1882), American diplomatist
and philologist, was born at Woodstock, Vermont, on
the 15th of March 1801. He graduated at Dartmouth College
in 1820, was admitted to the bar in 1825, and practised law
at Burlington, Vermont, devoting himself also with ardour to
philological studies. In 1835 he was a member of the Supreme
Executive Council of Vermont, and from 1843 to 1849 a Whig
representative in Congress. In 1849 he was appointed United
States minister resident in Turkey, and in 1852-1853 discharged
a mission to Greece in connexion with the imprisonment by
the authorities of that country of an American missionary,
Dr Jonas King (1792-1869). He returned to Vermont in 1854,
and in 1857 was a member of the state railway commission.
In 1861 he became the first United States minister to the kingdom
of Italy, and died in that office at Vallombrosa on the 23rd of
July 1882. He was buried in a Protestant cemetery in Rome.
Marsh was an able linguist, writing and speaking with ease the
Scandinavian and half a dozen other European languages, a
remarkable philologist for his day, and a scholar of great breadth,
knowing much of military science, engraving and physics, as
well as of Icelandic, which was his specialty. He wrote many
articles for Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Universal Cyclopaedia</i>, and contributed
many reviews and letters to the <i>Nation</i>. His chief published
works are: <i>A Compendious Grammar of the Old Northern or
Icelandic Language</i> (1838), compiled and translated from the
grammars of Rask; <i>The Camel, his Organization, Habits, and Uses,
with Reference to his Introduction into the United States</i> (1856);
<i>Lectures on the English Language</i> (1860); <i>The Origin and History
of the English Language</i> (1862; revised ed., 1885); and <i>Man
and Nature</i> (1865). The last-named work was translated into
Italian in 1872, and, largely rewritten, was issued in 1874 under
the title <i>The Earth as Modified by Human Action</i>; a revised
edition was published in 1885. He also published a work on
<i>Mediaeval and Modern Saints and Miracles</i> (1876). His valuable
library was presented in 1883 by Frederick Billings to the
university of Vermont. His second wife, <span class="sc">Caroline (Crane)
Marsh</span> (1816-1901), whom he married in 1839, published <i>Wolfe
of the Knoll and other Poems</i> (1860), and the <i>Life and Letters of
George Perkins Marsh</i> (New York, 1888). This last work was
left incomplete, the second volume never having been published.
She also translated from the German of Johann C.
Biernatzki (1795-1840), <i>The Hallig; or the Sheepfold in the
Waters</i> (1856).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSH, HERBERT<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (1757-1839), English divine, was born at
Faversham, Kent, on the 10th of December 1757, and was
educated at St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where he was elected
fellow in 1782, having been second wrangler and second Smith&rsquo;s
prizeman. For some years he studied at Leipzig, and between
1793 and 1801 published in four volumes a translation of
J. D. Michaelis&rsquo;s <i>Introduction to the New Testament</i>, with
notes of his own, in which he may be said to have introduced
German methods of research into English biblical
scholarship. His <i>History of the Politics of Great Britain and
France</i> (1799) brought him much notice and a pension
from William Pitt. In 1807 he was appointed Lady Margaret
professor of divinity at Cambridge, and lectured to large
audiences on biblical criticism, substituting English for the
traditional Latin. Both here, and afterwards as bishop of
Llandaff (1816) and of Peterborough (1819), he stoutly opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page769" id="page769"></a>769</span>
hymn-singing, Calvinism, Roman Catholicism, and the Evangelical
movement as represented by Charles Simeon and the Bible
Society. Among his writings are <i>Lectures on the Criticism and
Interpretation of the Bible</i> (1828), <i>A Comparative View of the
Churches of England and Rome</i> (1814), and <i>Horae Pelasgicae</i>

<p><span class="bold">MARSH, NARCISSUS<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (1638-1713), archbishop of Dublin and
Armagh, was born at Hannington, Wiltshire, and educated at
Oxford. He became a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1658.
In 1662 he was ordained, and presented to the living of Swindon,
which he resigned in the following year. After acting as chaplain
to Seth Ward, bishop of Exeter and Salisbury, and Lord
Chancellor Clarendon, he was elected principal of St Alban Hall,
Oxford, in 1673. In 1679 he was appointed provost of Trinity
College, Dublin, where he did much to encourage the study of the
Irish language. He helped to found the Royal Dublin Society,
and contributed to it a paper entitled &ldquo;Introductory Essay to
the Doctrine of Sounds&rdquo; (printed in <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
No. 156, Oxford, 1684). In 1683 he was consecrated bishop of
Ferns and Leighlin, but after the accession of James II. he was
compelled by the turbulent soldiery to flee to England (1689),
where he became vicar of Gresford, Flint, and canon of St Asaph.
Returning to Ireland in 1691 after the battle of the Boyne, he
was made archbishop of Cashel, and three years later he became
archbishop of Dublin. About this time he founded the Marsh
Library in Dublin. He became archbishop of Armagh in 1703.
Between 1699 and 1711 he was six times a lord justice of Ireland.
He died on the 2nd of November 1713.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSH, OTHNIEL CHARLES<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1831-1899), American
palaeontologist, was born in Lockport, New York, on the 29th
of October 1831. He graduated at Yale College in 1860, and
studied geology and mineralogy in the Sheffield scientific school,
New Haven, and afterwards palaeontology and anatomy in
Berlin, Heidelberg and Breslau. Returning to America in 1866
he was appointed professor of vertebrate palaeontology at Yale
College, and there began the researches of the fossil vertebrata
of the western states, whereby he established his reputation. He
was aided by a private fortune from his uncle, George Peabody,
whom he induced to establish the Peabody Museum of Natural
History (especially devoted to zoology, geology and mineralogy)
in the college. In May 1871 he discovered the first pterodactyl
remains found in America, and in subsequent years he brought to
light from Wyoming and other regions many new genera and
families, and some entirely new orders of extinct vertebrata,
which he described in monographs or periodical articles. These
included remains of the Cretaceous toothed birds <i>Hesperornis</i>
and <i>Ichthyornis</i>, the Cretaceous flying-reptiles (<i>Pteranodon</i>),
the swimming reptiles or Mosasauria, and the Cretaceous and
Jurassic land reptiles (<i>Dinosauria</i>) among which were the <i>Brontosaurus</i>
and <i>Atlantosaurus</i>. The remarkable mammals which he
termed Brontotheria (now grouped as Titanotheriidae), and the
huge Dinocerata, one being the <i>Uintatherium</i>, were also brought
to light by him. Among his later discoveries were remains of
early ancestors of horses in America. On becoming vice-president
of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science in 1875 he gave an address on the &ldquo;Introduction and
Succession of Vertebrate Life in America,&rdquo; summarizing his
conclusions to that date. He repeatedly organized and often
accompanied scientific exploring expeditions in the Rocky
Mountains, and their results tended in an important degree to
support the doctrines of natural selection and evolution. He
published many papers on these, and found time&mdash;besides that
necessarily given to the accumulation and care of the most
extensive collection of fossils in the world&mdash;to write <i>Odontornithes:
A Monograph on the Extinct Toothed Birds of North
America</i> (1880); <i>Dinocerata: A Monograph on an Extinct Order
of Gigantic Mammals</i> (1884); and <i>The Dinosaurs of North America</i>
(1896). His work is full of accurately recorded facts of permanent
value. He was long in charge of the division of vertebrate
palaeontology in the United States Geological Survey, and
received many scientific honours, medals and degrees, American
and foreign. He died in New Haven on the 18th of March 1899.</p>

pools; cf. Ger. <i>Meer</i>, sea, Lat. <i>mare</i>), an area of low-lying
watery land. The significance of a marsh area is not so much
in the manner of its formation as in the peculiar chemical and
physical results that accompany it, and its relation to the ecology
of plant and animal life. Chemically it is productive of such
gases as arise from decomposing vegetation and are transitory
in their effects, and in the production of hydrated iron oxide,
which may be seen floating as an iridescent scum at the edge of
rusty, marshy pools. This sinks into the soil and forms a
powerful iron cement to many sandstones, binding them into a
hard local mass, while the surrounding sandstones are loose and
friable. A curious morphological inversion follows in a later
geological period, the marsh area forming the hard cap of a hill
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mesa</a></span>) while the surrounding sandstones are weathered
away. Salt marshes are a feature of many low-lying sea-coasts
and areas of inland drainage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSHAL<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (med. Lat. <i>marescalcus</i>, from O.H.Ger. <i>marah</i>,
horse, and <i>scalc</i>, servant), a title given in various countries
to certain military and civil officers, usually of high rank. The
origin and development of the meaning of the designation is
closely analogous with that of constable (<i>q.v.</i>). Just as the title
of constable, in all its medieval and modern uses, is traceable to
the style and functions of the Byzantine count of the stable, so
that of marshal was evolved from the title of the <i>marescalci</i>,
or masters of the horse, of the early Frankish kings. In this
original sense the word survived down to the close of the Holy
Roman empire in the titular office of <i>Erz-Marschalk</i> (arch-marshal),
borne by the electors of Saxony. Elsewhere the
meaning of office and title was modified. The importance of
cavalry in medieval warfare led to the marshalship being associated
with military command; this again led to the duty of keeping
order in court and camp, of deciding questions of chivalry, and
to the assumption of judicial and executive functions. The
marshal, as a military leader, was originally a subordinate officer,
the chief command under the king being held by the constable;
but in the 12th century, though still nominally second to the
constable, the marshal has come to the forefront as commander
of the royal forces and a great officer of state. In England after
the Conquest the marshalship was hereditary in the family which
derived its surname from the office, and the hereditary title of
earl-marshal originated in the marriage of William Marshal
with the heiress of the earldom of Pembroke (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Earl Marshal</a></span>).
Similarly, in Scotland, the office of marischal (from the French
<i>maréchal</i>), probably introduced under David I., became in the 14th
century hereditary in the house of Keith. In 1485 the Scottish
marischal became an earl under the designation of earl-marischal,
the dignity coming to an end by the attainder of George, 10th
earl-marischal, in 1716. In France, on the other hand, though
under Philip Augustus the marshal of France (<i>marescalcus
Franciae</i>) appears as commander-in-chief of the forces, care was
taken not to allow the office to become descendible; under
Francis I. the number of marshals of France was raised to two,
under Henry III. to four, and under Louis XIV. to twenty.
Revived by Napoleon, the title fell into abeyance with the
downfall of the Second empire.</p>

<p>In England the use of the word marshal in the sense of commander
of an army appears very early; so Matthew Paris records
that in 1214 King John constituted William, earl of Salisbury,
<i>marescalcus</i> of his forces. The modern military title of field
marshal, imported from Germany by King George II. in 1736,
is derived from the high dignity of the <i>marescalcus</i> in a roundabout
way. The <i>marescalcus campi</i>, or <i>maréchal des champs</i>, was
originally one of a number of officials to whom the name, with
certain of the functions, of the marshal was given. The marshal,
being responsible for order in court and camp, had to employ
subordinates, who developed into officials often but nominally
dependent upon him. On military expeditions it was usual
for two such marshals to precede the army, select the site of the
camp and assign to the lords and knights their places in it. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page770" id="page770"></a>770</span>
time of peace they preceded the king on a journey and arranged
for his lodging and maintenance. In France <i>maréchal des logis</i>
is the title of superior non-commissioned officers in the cavalry.</p>

<p>Similarly at the king&rsquo;s court the <i>marescalcus aulae</i> or <i>intrinsecus</i>
was responsible for order, the admission or exclusion of
those seeking access, ceremonial arrangements, &amp;c. Such
&ldquo;marshals&rdquo; were maintained, not only by the king, but by great
lords and ecclesiastics. The more dignified of their functions,
together with the title, survive in the various German courts,
where the court marshal (<i>Hofmarschall</i>) is equivalent to the
English lord chamberlain. Just as the <i>marescalcus intrinsecus</i>
acted as the vicar of the marshal for duties &ldquo;within&rdquo; the court,
so the <i>marescalcus forinsecus</i> was deputed to perform those acts
of serjeanty due from the marshal to the Crown &ldquo;without.&rdquo;
Similarly there appears in the statute 5 Edw. III. cap. 8, a
<i>marescalcus banci regii</i> (<i>maréchal du Banc du Roy</i>), or marshal
of the king&rsquo;s bench, who presided over the Marshalsea Court,
and was responsible for the safe custody of prisoners, who were
bestowed in the <i>mareschalcia</i>, or Marshalsea prison. The office
of marshal of the queen&rsquo;s bench survived till 1849 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord
Steward</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marshalsea</a></span>). The official known as a judge&rsquo;s
marshal, whose office is of considerable antiquity, and whose
duties consisted of making abstracts of indictments and pleadings
for the use of the judge, still survives, but no longer exercises the
above functions. He accompanies a judge of assize on circuit
and is appointed by him at the beginning of each circuit. His
travelling and other expenses are paid by the judge, and he
receives an allowance of two guineas a day, which is paid through
the Treasury. He introduces the high sheriff of the county to
the judge of assize on his arrival, and swears in the grand
jury. For the French <i>maréchaussée</i> see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>: § <i>Law and
Institutions</i>.</p>

<p>In the sense of executive legal officer the title marshal survives
in the United States of America in two senses. The United
States marshal is the executive officer of the Federal courts, one
being appointed for each district, or exceptionally, one for two
districts. His duties are to open and close the sessions of the
district and circuit courts, serve warrants, and execute throughout
the district the orders of the court. There are United States
marshals also in Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Philippines.
They are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent
of the Senate, for a term of four years, and, besides their duties
in connexion with the courts, are employed in the service of the
internal revenue, public lands, post office, &amp;c. The temporary
police sworn in to maintain order in times of disturbance, known
in England as special constables, are also termed marshals in the
United States. In some of the southern and western states of the
Union the title marshal has sunk to that of the village policeman,
as distinct from the county officers known as sheriffs and those
of the justices&rsquo; courts called constables.</p>

<p>In England the title of marshal, as applied to an executive
officer, survives only in the army, where the provost marshal
is chief of the military police in large garrisons and in field forces.
Office and title were borrowed from the French <i>prévot des
maréchaux</i>, the modern equivalent of the medieval <i>praepositus
marescalcorum</i> or <i>guerrarum</i>.</p>

the Merchant Taylors&rsquo; School and St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,

<p><span class="bold">MARSHALL, JOHN<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1755-1835), American jurist, chief-justice
of the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on the 24th of September
1755 at Germantown (now Midland), in what four years
later became Fauquier county, Virginia. He was of English
descent, the son of Thomas Marshall (1732-1806) and his wife
Mary Isham Keith. Marshall served first as lieutenant and after
July 1778 as captain in the Continental Army during the War
of Independence. He resigned his commission early in 1781;
was admitted to the bar after a brief course of study, first
practised in Fauquier county; and after two years began to
practise in Richmond. In 1786 we find him counsel in a case
of great importance, <i>Hite</i> v. <i>Fairfax</i>, involving the original title
of Lord Fairfax to that large tract of country between the headwaters
of the Potomac and Rappahannock, known as the northern
neck of Virginia. Marshall represented tenants of Lord
Fairfax and won his case. From this time, as is shown by
an examination of Call&rsquo;s <i>Virginia Reports</i> which cover the period,
he maintained the leadership of the bar of Virginia. He was a
member of the Virginia Assembly in 1782-1791 and again in 1795-1797;
and in 1788, he took a leading part in the Virginia Convention
called to act on the proposed constitution for the United
States, with Madison ably urging the ratification of that instrument.
In 1795 Washington offered him the attorney-generalship,
and in 1796, after the retirement of James Monroe, the position
of minister to France. Marshall declined both offers because
his situation at the bar appeared to him &ldquo;to be more independent
and not less honourable than any other,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;preference
for it was decided.&rdquo; He spent the autumn and winter of
1797-1798 in France as one of the three commissioners appointed
by President John Adams to adjust the differences between
the young republic and the directory. The commission failed,
but the course pursued by Marshall was approved in America,
and with the resentment felt because of the way in which the
commission had been treated in France, made him, on his return,
exceedingly popular. To this popularity, as well as to the earnest
advocacy of Patrick Henry, he owed his election as a Federalist
to the National House of Representatives in the spring of 1799,
though the feeling in Richmond was overwhelmingly in favour
of the opposition or Republican party. His most notable service
in Congress was his speech on the case of Thomas Nash, alias
Jonathan Robbins, in which he showed that there is nothing
in the constitution of the United States which prevents the
Federal government from carrying out an extradition treaty.
He was secretary of state under President Adams from the 6th
of June 1800 to the 4th of March 1801. In the meantime he
had been appointed chief-justice of the Supreme Court, his
commission bearing date the 31st of January. Thus while still
secretary he presided as chief-justice.</p>

<p>At the time of Marshall&rsquo;s appointment it was generally considered
that the Supreme Court was the one department of the
new government which had failed in its purpose. John Jay, the
first chief-justice, who had resigned in 1795, had just declined
a reappointment to the chief-justiceship on the ground that he
had left the bench perfectly convinced that the court would never
acquire proper weight and dignity, its organization being fatally
defective. The advent of the new chief-justice was marked by a
change in the conduct of business in the court. Since its organization,
following the prevailing English custom, the judges had
pronounced their opinions seriatim. But beginning with the
December term 1801, the chief-justice became practically the
sole mouthpiece of the court. For eleven years the opinions
are almost exclusively his, and there are few recorded dissents.
The change was admirably adapted to strengthen the power and
dignity of the court. The chief-justice embodied the majesty
of the judicial department of the government almost as fully as
the president stood for the power of the executive. That this
change was acquiesced in by his associates without diminishing
their goodwill towards their new chief is testimony to the persuasive
force of Marshall&rsquo;s personality; for his associates were
not men of mediocre ability. After the advent of Mr Justice
Joseph Story the practice was abandoned. Marshall, however,
still delivered the opinion in the great majority of cases, and in
practically all cases of any importance involving the interpretation
of the Constitution. During the course of his judicial
life his associates were as a rule men of learning and ability.
During most of the time the majority were the appointees of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page771" id="page771"></a>771</span>
Democratic presidents, and before their elevation to the bench
supposed to be out of sympathy with the federalistic ideas of the
chief-justice. Yet in matters pertaining to constitutional construction,
they seem to have had hardly any other function than
to add the weight of their silent concurrence to the decision of
their great chief. Thus the task of expounding the constitution
during the most critical period of its history was his, and it
was given to him to preside over the Supreme Court when it was
called upon to decide four cases of vital importance: <i>Marbury</i>
v. <i>Madison</i>, <i>M&lsquo;Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia</i> and
<i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden</i>. In each of these cases it is Marshall who
writes the opinion of the court; in each the continued existence
of the peculiar Federal system established by the Constitution
depended on the action of the court, and in each the court
adopted a principle which is now generally perceived to be
essential to the preservation of the United States as a federal
state.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, which was decided two years after his
elevation to the bench, he decided that it was the duty of the court
to disregard any act of Congress, and, therefore, a fortiori any act
of a legislature of one of the states, which the court thought contrary
to the Federal Constitution.</p>

<p>In <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>, in spite of the contention of Jefferson and
the then prevalent school of political thought that it was contrary
to the Constitution for a person to bring one of the states of the
United States, though only as an appellee, into a court of justice,
he held that Congress could lawfully pass an act which permitted a
person who was convicted in a state court, to appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States, if he alleged that the state act under which
he was convicted conflicted with the Federal Constitution or with an
act of Congress.</p>

<p>In <i>M&lsquo;Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, though admitting that the Federal
government is one of delegated powers and cannot exercise any power
not expressly given in the Constitution, he laid down the rule that
Congress in the exercise of a delegated power has a wide latitude in
the choice of means, not being confined in its choice of means to
those which must be used if the power is to be exercised at all.</p>

<p>Lastly, in <i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden</i>, he held that when the power to regulate
interstate and foreign commerce was conferred by the Constitution
on the Federal government, the word &ldquo;commerce&rdquo; included
not only the exchange of commodities, but the means by which
interstate and foreign intercourse was carried on, and therefore
that Congress had the power to license vessels to carry goods and
passengers between the states, and an act of one of the states making
a regulation which interfered with such regulation of Congress was,
<i>pro tanto</i>, of no effect. It will be seen that in the first two cases
he established the Supreme Court as the final interpreter of the
Constitution.</p>

<p>The decision in <i>M&lsquo;Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>, by leaving Congress
unhampered in the choice of means to execute its delegated powers,
made it possible for the Federal government to accomplish the ends
of its existence. &ldquo;Let the end be legitimate,&rdquo; said Marshall in the
course of its opinion, &ldquo;let it be within the scope of the Constitution,
and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted
to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter
and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the decision in <i>M&lsquo;Culloch</i> v. <i>Maryland</i> gave vigour to all
Federal power, the decision in <i>Gibbons</i> v. <i>Ogden</i>, by giving the Federal
government control over the means by which interstate and foreign
commerce is carried on, preserved the material prosperity of the
country. The decision recognizes what the framers of the Constitution
recognized, namely that the United States is an economic
union, and that business which is national should be under national,
not state, control.</p>
</div>

<p>Though for the reasons stated, the four cases mentioned
are the most important of his decisions, the value of his work
as an expounder of the Constitution of the United States is not
to be measured by these cases alone. In all he decided forty-four
cases involving constitutional questions. Nearly every important
part of the Constitution of the United States as it existed
before the amendments which were adopted after the Civil
War, is treated in one or more of them. The Constitution in its
most important aspects is the Constitution as he interpreted it.
He did not work out completely the position of the states in
the Federal system, but he did grasp and establish the position
of the Federal legislature and the Federal judiciary. To
appreciate his work, however, it is necessary to see that it was
the work not of a statesman but of a judge. Had Marshall
been merely a far-seeing statesman, while most of his important
cases would have been decided as he decided them, his life-work
would have been a failure. It was not only necessary
that he should decide great constitutional questions properly,
but also that the people of the United States should be convinced
of the correctness of his interpretation of the Constitution.
His opinions, therefore, had to carry to those who studied them
a conviction that the constitution as written had been interpreted
according to its evident meaning. They fulfilled this prime
requisite. Their chief characteristic is the cumulative force
of the argument. The ground for the premiss is carefully
prepared, the premiss itself is clearly stated; nearly every
possible objection is examined and answered; and then comes
the conclusion. There is little or no repetition, but there is a
wealth of illustration, a completeness of analysis, that convinces
the reader, not only that the subject has been adequately
treated, but that it has been exhausted. His style, reflecting
his character, suits perfectly the subject matter. Simple in
the best sense of the word, his intellectual processes were so
clear that he never doubted the correctness of the conclusion
to which they led him. Apparently from his own point of
view, he merely indicated the question at issue, and the inexorable
rules of logic did the rest. Thus his opinions are simple,
clear, dignified. Intensely interesting, the interest is in the
argument, not in its expression. He had, in a wonderful degree,
the power of phrase. He expressed important principles of
law in language which tersely yet clearly conveyed his exact
meaning. Not only is the Constitution interpreted largely
as he taught the people of the United States to interpret it,
but when they wish to express important constitutional principles
which he enunciated they use his exact words. Again,
his opinions show that he adhered closely to the words of the
Constitution; indeed no one who has attempted to expound
that instrument has confined himself more strictly to an
examination of the text. In the proper, though not in the
historical, sense he was the strictest of strict constructionalists,
and as a result his opinions are practically devoid of theories
of government, sovereignty and the rights of man.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A single illustration of his avoidance of all theory and his adherence
to the words of the Constitution will suffice. In the case of the
<i>United States</i> v. <i>Fisher</i> the constitutional question involved was the
power of Congress to give to the United States a preference over all
other creditors in the distribution of the assets of a bankrupt. Such
an act can be upheld on the ground that all governments have
necessarily the right to give themselves priority. Not so Marshall.
To him the act must be supported, if supported at all, not on any
theory of the innate nature of the government, national or otherwise,
but as a reasonable means of carrying out one of the express powers
conferred by the Constitution on the Federal government. Thus,
he upholds the act in question because of the power expressly
conferred on the Federal government to pay the debts of the union,
and as a necessary consequence of this power the right to make
remittances by bills or otherwise and to take precautions which will
render the transactions safe.</p>
</div>

<p>It is important to emphasize the fact that Marshall adhered
in his opinions to the Constitution as written, not only because
it is a fact which must be recognized if we are to understand
the correct value of his work in the field of constitutional law,
but also because there exists to-day a popular impression that
by implication he stretched to the utmost the powers of the
Federal government. This impression is due primarily to the
ignorance of many of those who have undertaken to praise
him. During his life he was charged by followers of the
States Rights School of political thought with upholding Federal
power in cases not warranted by the constitution. Later,
however, those who admired a strong national government,
without taking the trouble to ascertain whether the old criticism
by members of the States Rights Party was just, regarded
the assumption on which it was founded as Marshall&rsquo;s best claim
to his country&rsquo;s gratitude.</p>

<p>As a constitutional lawyer, Marshall stands without a rival.
His work on international law and admiralty is of first rank.
But though a good, he was not a great, common law or equity
lawyer. In these fields he did not make new law nor clarify
what was obscure, and his constitutional opinions which to-day
are found least satisfactory are those in which the question to be
solved necessarily involves the discussion of some common-law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page772" id="page772"></a>772</span>
conception, especially those cases in which he was required
to construe the restriction imposed by the Constitution on any
state impairing the obligation of contracts. His decision in
the celebrated case of <i>Dartmouth College</i> v. <i>Woodward</i>, in which
he held that a state could not repeal a charter of a private
corporation, because a charter is a contract which a subsequent
act of the state repealing the charter impairs, though of great
economic importance, does not touch any fundamental question
of constitutional law. The argument which he advances lacks
the clearness and finality for which most of his opinions are
celebrated. It is not certain with whom he thought the contract
was made: with the corporation created by the charter, with the
trustees of the corporation, or with those who had contributed
money to its objects.</p>

<p>Of the wonderful persuasive force of Marshall&rsquo;s personality
there is abundant evidence. His influence over his associates,
already referred to, is but one example though a most impressive
one. From the moment he delivered the opinion in <i>Marbury</i>
v. <i>Madison</i> the legal profession knew that he was a great judge.
Each year added to his reputation and made for a better
appreciation of his intellectual and moral qualities. The bar
of the Supreme Court during his chief-justiceship was the most
brilliant which the United States has ever known. Leaders,
not only of legal, but political thought were among its members;
one, Webster, was a man of genius and commanding position.
To a very great degree Marshall impressed on the members
of this bar and on the profession generally his own ideas of
the correct interpretation of the Constitution and his own love
for the union. He did this, not merely by his arguments but
by the influence which was his by right of his strong, sweet
nature. Statesmen and politicians, great and  small, were at
this time, almost without exception, members of the bar. To
influence the political thought of the bar was to a great extent
to influence the political thought of the people.</p>

<p>In 1782 he married Mary Willis Ambler, the daughter of
the then treasurer of Virginia. They had ten children, six
of whom grew to full age. For the greater part of the forty-eight
years of their married life Mrs Marshall suffered intensely
from a nervous affliction. Her condition called out the
love and sympathy of her husband&rsquo;s deep and affectionate
nature. Judge Story tells us: &ldquo;That which, in a just sense,
was his highest glory, was the purity, affectionateness, liberality
and devotedness of his domestic life.&rdquo; For the first thirty
years of his chief-justiceship his life was a singularly happy one.
He never had to remain in Washington for more than three
months. During the rest of the year, with the exception of
a visit to Raleigh, which his duties as circuit judge required
him to make, and a visit to his old home in Fauquier county,
he lived in Richmond. His house on Shockhoe Hill is still
standing.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day 1831 his wife died. He never was quite
the same again. On returning from Washington in the spring
of 1835 he suffered severe contusions, from an accident to the
stage coach in which he was riding. His health, which had not
been good, now rapidly declined and in June he returned to
Philadelphia for medical attendance. There he died on the
6th of July. His body, which was taken to Richmond, lies
in Shockhoe Hill Cemetery under a plain marble slab, on which
is a simple inscription written by himself. In addition to his
decisions Marshall wrote a famous biography of George Washington
(5 vols., 1804-1807; 2nd ed., 2 vols., 1832), which though
prepared hastily contains much material of value.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSHALL, JOHN<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (1818-1891), British surgeon and physiologist,
was born at Ely, on the 11th of September 1818, his father
being a lawyer of that city. He entered University College,
London, in 1838, and in 1847 he was appointed assistant-surgeon
at the hospital, becoming in 1866 surgeon and professor of
surgery. He was professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy
from 1873 till his death. In 1883 he was president of the
College of Surgeons, also Bradshaw lecturer (on &ldquo;Nerve-stretching
for the relief or cure of pain&rdquo;), Hunterian orator in
1885, and Morton lecturer in 1889. In 1867 he published his
well-known textbook <i>The Outlines of Physiology</i> in two volumes.
He died on the 1st of January 1891. &ldquo;Marshall&rsquo;s fame,&rdquo;
wrote Sir W. MacCormac in his volume on the <i>Centenary of the
College of Surgeons</i> (1900), &ldquo;rests on the great ability with which
he taught anatomy in relation to art, on the introduction into
modern surgery of the galvano-cautery, and on the operation
for the excision of varicose veins. He was one of the first to
show that cholera might be spread by means of drinking water,
and issued a report on the outbreak of cholera in Broad Street,
St James&rsquo;s, 1854. He also invented the system of circular
wards for hospitals, and to him are largely owing the details
of the modern medical student&rsquo;s education.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSHALL, STEPHEN<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1594-1655), English Nonconformist
divine, was born at Godmanchester in Huntingdonshire, and
was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (M.A. 1622,
B.D. 1629). After holding the living of Wethersfield in Essex
he became vicar of Finchingfield in the same county, and in
1636 was reported for &ldquo;want of conformity.&rdquo; He was a
preacher of great power, and influenced the elections for the
Short Parliament of 1640. Clarendon esteemed his influence
on the parliamentary side greater than that of Laud on the
royalist. In 1642 he was appointed lecturer at St Margaret&rsquo;s,
Westminster, and delivered a series of addresses to the Commons
in which he advocated episcopal and liturgical reform. He had
a share in writing <i>Smectymnuus</i>, was appointed chaplain to the
earl of Essex&rsquo;s regiment in 1642, and a member of the Westminster
Assembly in 1643. He represented the English Parliament in
Scotland in 1643, and attended the parliamentary commissions
at the Uxbridge Conference in 1645. He waited on Archbishop
Laud before his execution, and was chaplain to Charles I. at
Holmby House and at Carisbrooke. A moderate and judicious
presbyterian, he prepared with others the &ldquo;Shorter Catechism&rdquo;
in 1647, and was one of the &ldquo;Triers,&rdquo; 1654. He died in November
1655 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, but his body was
exhumed and maltreated at the Restoration. His sermons,

<p><span class="bold">MARSHALL,<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Saline county,
Missouri, U.S.A., situated a little W. of the centre of the state,
near the Salt Fork of the La Mine River. Pop. (1890), 4297;
(1900), 5086 (208 being foreign-born and 98 negroes); (1910)
4869. It is served by the Missouri Pacific and the Chicago
&amp; Alton railways. The city is laid out regularly on a high,
undulating prairie. It is the seat of Missouri Valley College
(opened 1889; co-educational), which was established by the
Cumberland Presbyterian church, and includes a preparatory
department and a conservatory of music. The court-house
(1883), a Roman Catholic convent and a high school (1907)
are the principal buildings. The Missouri colony for the
feeble-minded and epileptic (1899) is at Marshall. The
principal trade is with the surrounding farming country.
The municipality owns and operates the waterworks. Marshall
was first settled and was made the county seat in 1839; it
became a town in 1866 (re-incorporated 1870) and a city in
1878.</p>

Indian corn, vegetables, small fruits and sugar-cane; in the
surrounding country there are valuable forests of pine, oak and
gum. In the vicinity of the city there are several lakes (including
Caddo Lake) and springs (including Hynson and Rosborough
springs). The city has a cotton compress, and among its manufactures
are cotton-seed oil, lumber, ice, foundry products
and canned goods. The municipality owns and operates the
waterworks. Marshall was first settled in 1842, was incorporated
in 1843, and received a city charter in 1848; in 1909 it adopted
the commission form of government.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSHALL ISLANDS,<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> an island group in the western Pacific
Ocean (Micronesia) belonging to Germany. The group consists
of a number of atolls ranged in two almost parallel lines, which
run from N.W. to S.E. between 4° and 15° N. and 161° and
174° E. The north-east line, with fifteen islands, is called
Ratak, the other, numbering eighteen, Ralik. These atolls
are of coralline formation and of irregular shape. They rise
but little above high-water mark. The highest elevation occurs
on the island of Likieb, but is only 33 ft. The lagoon is scarcely
more than 150 ft. deep and is accessible through numerous
breaks in the reef. On the outward side the shore sinks rapidly
to a great depth. The surface of the atolls is covered with
sand, except in a few places where it has been turned into soil
through the admixture of decayed vegetation. The reef in
scarcely any instance exceeds 600 ft. in width.</p>

<p>The climate is moist and hot, the mean temperature being
80.50° F. Easterly winds prevail all the year round. There
is no difference between the seasons, which, though the islands
belong to the northern hemisphere, have the highest temperature
in January and the lowest in July. Vegetation, on the whole,
is very poor. There are many coco-nut palms, bread-fruit
trees (<i>Artocarpus incisa</i>), various kinds of bananas, yams and
taro, and pandanus, of which the natives eat the seeds. From
the bark of another plant they manufacture mats. There are
few animals. Cattle do not thrive, and even poultry are scarce.
Pigs, cats, dogs and rats have been imported. There are a few
pigeons and aquatic birds, butterflies and beetles. Crustacea
and fish abound on the reefs.</p>

<p>The natives are Micronesians of a dark brown colour, though
lighter shades occur. Their hair is not woolly but straight and
long. They practise tattooing, and show Papuan influence
by distending the ear-lobes by the insertion of wooden disks.
They are expert navigators, and construct curious charts of
thin strips of wood tied together with fibres, some giving the
position of the islands and some the direction of the prevailing
winds. Their canoes carry sails and are made of the trunk
of the bread-fruit tree. The people are divided into four classes,
of which only two are allowed to own land. The islands lie
entirely within the German sphere of interest, and the boundaries
were agreed upon between Great Britain and Germany on the
10th of April 1889. Their area is estimated at 160 sq. m.,
with 15,000 inhabitants, who are apparently increasing, though
the contrary was long believed. All but about 250 are natives.
The administrator of the islands is the governor of German
New Guinea, but a number of officials reside on the islands.
There is no military force, the natives being of peaceful disposition.
The chief island and seat of government is Jaluit. The
most populous island is Majeru, with 1600 inhabitants. The
natives are generally pagans, but a Roman Catholic mission
has been established, and the American Mission Board maintains
coloured teachers on many of the islands. There is communication
with Sydney by private steamer, and a steamer
sails between Jaluit and Ponape to connect with the French
boats for Singapore. The chief products for export are copra,
tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, sharks&rsquo; fins and trepang. The
natives are clever boat-builders, and find a market for their
canoes on neighbouring islands. They have made such progress
in their art that they have even built seaworthy little schooners
of 30 to 40 tons. The only other articles they make are a few
shell ornaments.</p>

<p>The Marshall Islands may have been visited by Alvaro de
Saavedra in 1529, Captain Wallis touched at the group in 1767,
and in 1788 Captains Marshall and Gilbert explored it. The
Germans made a treaty with the chieftains of Jaluit in 1878
and annexed the group in 1885-1886.</p>

between the Mississippi river and Green Bay, and among the
original owners of the town site were Samuel Marsh of Massachusetts
(in whose honour the place was named) and Horatio

<p><span class="bold">MARSH GAS<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (methane), CH<span class="su">4</span>, the first member of the series
of paraffin hydrocarbons. It occurs as a constituent of the
&ldquo;fire-damp&rdquo; of coal-mines, in the gases evolved from volcanoes,
and in the gases which arise in marshy districts (due to the
decomposition of vegetable matter under the surface of water).
It is found associated with petroleum and also in human intestinal
gases. It is a product of the destructive distillation of
complex organic matter (wood, coal, bituminous shale, &amp;c.),
forming in this way from 30 to 40% of ordinary illuminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page774" id="page774"></a>774</span>
gas. It may be synthetically obtained by passing a mixture of
the vapour of carbon bisulphide with sulphuretted hydrogen over
red-hot copper (M. Berthelot, <i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1856, 43, p. 236),
CS<span class="su">2</span> + 2H<span class="su">2</span>S + 8Cu = 4Cu<span class="su">2</span>S + CH<span class="su">4</span>; by passing a mixture of
hydrogen and carbon monoxide over reduced nickel at 200-250°
C., or hydrogen and carbon dioxide at 230-300° C. (P. Sabatier
and J. B. Senderens, <i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1902, 134, pp. 514, 689);
by the decomposition of aluminium carbide with water [H.
Moissan, <i>Bull. Soc. Chim.</i>, 1894, (3) 11, p. 1012]; and by heating
phosphonium iodide with carbon bisulphide in a sealed tube
to 120-140° C. (H. Jahn, <i>Ber.</i>, 1880, 13, p. 127). It is also
obtained by the reduction of many methyl compounds with
nascent hydrogen; thus methyl iodide dissolved in methyl
alcohol readily yields methane when acted on by the zinc-copper
couple (J. H. Gladstone and A. Tribe, <i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>,
1884, 45, p. 156) or by the aluminium-mercury couple. It may
be obtained in an indirect manner from methyl iodide by
conversion of this compound into zinc methyl, or into magnesium
methyl iodide (formed by the action of magnesium on
methyl iodide dissolved in anhydrous ether), and decomposing
these latter substances with water (E. Frankland, 1856; V.
Grignard, 1900),</p>

<p class="noind">In the laboratory it is usually prepared by J. B. A. Dumas&rsquo;
method (<i>Ann.</i>, 1840, 33, p. 181), which consists in heating anhydrous
sodium acetate with soda lime, CH<span class="su">3</span>CO<span class="su">2</span>Na + NaOH =
Na<span class="su">2</span>CO<span class="su">3</span> + CH<span class="su">4</span>. The product obtained by this method is not
pure, containing generally more or less ethylene and hydrogen.</p>

<p>Methane is a colourless gas of specific gravity 0.559 (air = 1).
It may be condensed to a colourless liquid at &minus;155° to &minus;160° C.
under atmospheric pressure (S. Wroblewsky, <i>Comptes rendus</i>,
1884, 99, p. 136). It boils at -162° C. and freezes at &minus;186° C. Its
critical temperature is &minus;99.5° C. (J. Dewar). The gas is almost
insoluble in water, but is slightly soluble in alcohol. It decomposes
into its constituents when passed through a red-hot tube,
small quantities of other hydrocarbons (ethane, ethylene,
acetylene, benzene, &amp;c.) being formed at the same time. It
burns with a pale flame, and when mixed with air or oxygen
forms a highly explosive mixture. W. A. Bone (<i>Jour. Chem.
Soc.</i>, 1902, 81, p. 535; 1903, 83, p. 1074) has shown that in the
oxidation of methane by oxygen at 450-500° C. formaldehyde
(or possibly methyl alcohol) is formed as an intermediate product,
and is ultimately oxidized to carbon dioxide. Methane is an
exceedingly stable gas, being unaffected by the action of chromic
acid, nitric acid, or a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids.
Chlorine and bromine, however, react with methane, gradually
replacing hydrogen and forming chlor- and brom-substitution
products.</p>

Westbury Leigh, in Wiltshire. He followed the occupation
of a weaver until 1794, but having meanwhile devoted himself
to study he removed to Broadmead, Bristol, to take charge of
a small school. In 1799 he was sent by the Baptist Missionary
Society to join their mission at Serampur. Here, in addition
to his more special duties, he studied Bengali and Sanskrit, and
afterwards Chinese. He translated the Bible into various
dialects, and, aided by his son, established newspapers and
founded Serampur College. He received the degree of D.D.
from Brown University, U.S.A., in 1810. He died at Serampur
on the 5th of December 1837. His son, John Clark Marshman

<p><span class="bold">MARSI,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> an ancient people of Italy, whose chief centre was
Marruvium, on the eastern shore of Lake Fucinus. They are
first mentioned as members of a confederacy with the Vestini,
Paeligni and Marrucini (Liv. viii. 29, cf. viii. 6, and Polyb. ii. 24,
12). They joined the Samnites in 308 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Liv. ix. 41), and on their
submission became allies of Rome in 304 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Liv. ix. 45). After
a short-lived revolt two years later, for which they were punished
by loss of territory (Liv. x. 3), they were readmitted to the Roman
alliance and remained faithful down to the social war, their
contingent (<i>e.g.</i> Liv. xliv. 46) being always regarded as the flower
of the Italian forces (<i>e.g.</i> Hor. <i>Od.</i> ii. 20, 18). In this war,
which, owing to the prominence of the Marsian rebels is often
known as the Marsic War, they fought bravely against odds
under their leader Q. Pompaedius Silo, and, though they were
frequently defeated, the result of the war was the enfranchisement
of the allies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a></span>: <i>History</i>, &ldquo;The Republic&rdquo;). The Marsi
were a hardy mountain people, famed for their simple habits
and indomitable courage. It was said that the Romans had
never triumphed over them or without them (Appian). They
were also renowned for their magicians, who had strange
remedies for various diseases.</p>

<p>The Latin colony of Alba Fucens near the north-west corner
of the lake was founded in the adjoining Aequian territory in
303, so that from the beginning of the 3rd century the Marsians
were in touch with a Latin-speaking community, to say nothing
of the Latin colony of Carsioli (298 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) farther west. The
earliest pure Latin inscriptions of the district seem to be <i>C.I.L.</i>
ix. 3827 and 3848 from the neighbourhood of Supinum; its
character generally is of the Gracchan period, though it might
be somewhat earlier.</p>

<p>Mommsen (<i>Unteritalische Dialekten</i>, p. 345) pointed out that
in the social war all the coins of Pompaedius Silo have the Latin
legend &ldquo;Italia,&rdquo; while the other leaders in all but one case used
Oscan.</p>

<p>The chief record of the dialect or patois we owe to the goddess
Angitia, whose chief temple and grove stood at the south-west
corner of Lake Fucinus, near the inlet to the <i>emissarius</i> of
Claudius (restored by Prince Torlonia), and the modern village
of Luco. She (or they, for the name is in the plural in the Latin
inscription next cited) was widely worshipped in the central
highlands (Sulmo, <i>C.I.L.</i> ix. 3074, Furfo Vestinorum, ibid. 3515)
as a goddess of healing, especially skilled to cure serpent bites by
charms and the herbs of the Marsian woods. Her worshippers
naturally practised the same arts&mdash;as their descendants do (see
A. de Nino&rsquo;s charming collection of <i>Usi e costumi abruzzesi</i>),
their country being in Rome counted the home of witchcraft; see
Hor. <i>Sal.</i> 1, 9, 29, <i>Epod.</i> 17, 28, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The earliest local inscriptions date from about 300 to 150 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
and include the interesting and difficult bronze of Lake Fucinus,
which seems to record a votive offering to Angitia, if <i>A(n)ctia</i>,
as is probable, was the local form of her name. Their language
differs very slightly from Roman Latin of that date; for apparently
contracted forms like <i>Fougno</i> instead of <i>Fucino</i> may really
only be a matter of spelling. In final syllables the diphthongs <i>ai</i>,
<i>ei</i>, <i>oi</i>, all appear as <i>&#275;</i>. On the other hand, the older form of the
name of the tribe (dat. plur. <i>Martses</i> = Lat. <i>Martiis</i>) shows its
derivation and exhibits the assibilation of <i>-tio-</i> into <i>-tso-</i> proper
to many Oscan dialects (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Osca Lingua</a></span>) but strange to classical
Latin.</p>

Count (1658-1730), Italian soldier and scientific writer, was
born at Bologna on the 10th of July 1658. After a course of
scientific studies in his native city he travelled through Turkey
collecting data on the military organization of that empire, as
well as on its natural history. On his return he entered the service
of the emperor Leopold (1682) and fought with distinction
against the Turks, by whom he was wounded and captured in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page775" id="page775"></a>775</span>
action on the river Raab, and sold to a pasha whom he accompanied
to the siege of Vienna. His release was purchased in 1684,
and he afterwards took part in the war of the Spanish succession.
In 1703 he was appointed second in command under Count
Arco in the defence of Alt-Breisach. The fortress surrendered
to the duke of Burgundy, and both Arco and Marsigli were
court martialled; the former was condemned to death and the
latter cashiered, although acquitted of blame by public opinion.
Having thus been forced to give up soldiering, he devoted the
rest of his life to scientific investigations, in the pursuit of which
he made many journeys through Europe, spending a considerable
time at Marseilles to study the nature of the sea. In 1712 he
presented his collections to his native city, where they formed the
nucleus of the Bologna Institute of Science and Art. He died
at Bologna on the 1st of November 1730. Marsigli was a fellow
of the London Royal Society and a member of the Paris Academy
of Science.</p>

master of Paris, the philosopher John of Jandun, who collaborated
with him in the composition of the famous <i>Defensor pacis</i>
(1324), one of the most extraordinary political and religious works
which appeared during the 14th century. A violent struggle
had just broken out between pope John XXII. and Louis of
Bavaria, king of the Romans, and the latter, on being excommunicated
and called upon to give up the empire, only replied
to the pope&rsquo;s threats with fresh provocations. Marsilius of
Padua and John of Jandun, though they had both reason to be
grateful for the benefits of John XXII., chose this moment to
demonstrate, by plausible arguments, the supremacy of the
Empire, its independence of the Holy See, and the emptiness
of the prerogatives &ldquo;usurped&rdquo; by the sovereign pontiffs&mdash;a
demonstration naturally calculated to give them a claim on the
gratitude of the German sovereign.</p>

<p>The <i>Defensor pacis</i>, as its name implies, is a work intended to
restore peace, as the most indispensable benefit of human society.
The author of the law is the people, <i>i.e.</i> the whole body, or at
least the most important part (<i>valentior</i>) of the citizens; the
people should themselves elect, or at least appoint, the head of
the government, who, lest he should be tempted to put himself
above the scope of the laws, should have at his disposal only a
limited armed force. This chief is responsible to the people for
his breaches of the law, and in serious cases they can condemn
him to death. The real cause of the trouble which prevails
among men is the papacy, a &ldquo;fictitious&rdquo; power, the development
of which is the result of a series of usurpations. Marsilius
denies, not only to the pope, but to the bishops and clergy, any
coercive jurisdiction or any right to pronounce on their own
authority excommunications and interdicts, or in any way to
impose the observation of the divine law. He is not opposed to
penalties against heretics, but he would have them pronounced
only by civil tribunals. Desiring to see the clergy practise a holy
poverty, he proposes the suppression of tithes and the seizure
by the secular power of the greater part of the property of the
church. The clergy, thus deprived of its wealth, privileges
and jurisdiction, is further to be deprived of independence, for
the civil power is to have the right of appointing to benefices,
&amp;c. The supreme authority in the church is to be the council,
but a council summoned by the emperor. The pope, no longer
possessing any more power than other bishops (though Marsilius
recognizes that the supremacy of the Church of Rome goes back
to the earliest times of Christianity), is to content himself with a
pre-eminence mainly of an honorary kind, without claiming
to interpret the Holy Scriptures, define dogmas or distribute
benefices; moreover, he is to be elected by the Christian people,
or by the delegates of the people, <i>i.e.</i> the princes, or by the
council, and these are also to have the power to punish, suspend
or depose him. Such is this famous work, full of obscurities,
redundancies and contradictions, in which the thread of the
argument is sometimes lost in a labyrinth of reasonings and
citations, both sacred and profane, but which nevertheless
expresses, both in religion and politics, such audacious and novel
ideas that it has been possible to trace in it, as it were, a rough
sketch of the doctrines developed during the periods of the
Reformation and of the French Revolution. The theory was
purely democratic, but was all ready to be transformed, by means
of a series of fictions and implications, into an imperialist doctrine;
and in like manner it contained a visionary plan of reformation
which ended, not in the separation of the church from the state,
but in the subjection of the church to the state. To overthrow
the ecclesiastical hierarchy, to deprive the clergy of all their
privileges, to reduce the pope to the rank of a kind of president
of a Christian republic, which governs itself, or rather submits
to the government of Caesar&mdash;such is the dream formed in 1324
by two masters of the university of Paris.</p>

<p>When in 1326 Louis of Bavaria saw the arrival in Nuremberg
of the two authors of the book dedicated to him, startled by
the boldness of their political and religious theories, he was at
first inclined to treat them as heretics. He soon changed his
mind, however, and, admitting them to the circle of his intimates,
loaded them with favours. Having become one of the chief
inspirers of the imperial policy, Marsilius accompanied Louis
of Bavaria to Italy, where he preached or circulated written
attacks against the pope, especially at Milan, and where he came
within the sight of the realization of his wildest utopias. To see
a king of the Romans crowned emperor at Rome, not by the
pope, but by those who claimed to be the delegates of the people
(Jan. 17, 1328), to see John XXII. deposed by the head
of the Empire (April 18), and a mendicant friar, Pietro de
Corbara, raised by an imperial decree to the throne of St Peter
(as Nicholas V.) after a sham of a popular election (May 12),
all this was merely the application of principles laid down in the
<i>Defensor pacis</i>. The two authors of this book played a most
active part in the Roman Revolution. Marsilius, appointed
imperial vicar, abused his power to persecute the clergy who had
remained faithful to John XXII. In recompense for his services,
he seems to have been appointed archbishop of Milan, while his
collaborator, John of Jandun, obtained from Louis of Bavaria
the bishopric of Ferrara.</p>

<p>Marsilius of Padua also composed a treatise <i>De translatione
imperii romani</i>, which is merely a rearrangement of a work of
Landolfo Colonna, <i>De jurisdictione imperatoris in causa matrimoniali</i>,
intended to prove the exclusive jurisdiction of the
emperor in matrimonial affairs, or rather, to justify the intervention
of Louis of Bavaria, who, in the interests of his policy,
had just annulled the marriage of the son of the king of Bohemia
and the countess of Tirol. But, above all, in an unpublished
work preserved at Oxford, the <i>Defensor minor</i>, Marsilius completed
and elaborated in a curious manner certain points in the
doctrine laid down in the <i>Defensor pacis</i>. In it he deals with
ecclesiastical jurisdiction, penances, indulgences, crusades and
pilgrimages, vows, excommunication, the pope and the council,
marriage and divorce. Here his democratic theory still more
clearly leads up to a proclamation of the imperial omnipotence.</p>

<p>Marsilius of Padua does not seem to have lived long after 1342.
But the scandal provoked by his <i>Defensor pacis</i>, condemned by
the court of Avignon in 1326, lasted much longer. Benedict
XII. and Clement VI. censured it in turn; Louis of Bavaria
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page776" id="page776"></a>776</span>
disowned it. Translated into French, then into Italian (14th
century) and into English (16th century), it was known by
Wycliffe and Luther, and was not without an influence on the
Reform movement.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSTON, JOHN<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1575-1634), English dramatist and
satirist, eldest son of John Marston of Coventry, at one time
lecturer of the Middle Temple, was born in 1575, or early in 1576.
Swinburne notes his affinities with Italian literature, which may
be partially explained by his parentage, for his mother was the
daughter of an Italian physician, Andrew Guarsi. He entered
Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1592, taking his B.A. degree in
1594. The elder Marston in his will expresses regret that his
son, to whom he left his law-books and the furniture of his rooms
in the Temple, had not been willing to follow his profession.
John Marston married Mary Wilkes, daughter of one of the
royal chaplains, and Ben Jonson said that &ldquo;Marston wrote his
father-in-law&rsquo;s preachings, and his father-in-law his sermons.&rdquo;
His first work was <i>The Metamorphosis of Pigmalions Image,
and certaine Satyres</i> (1598). &ldquo;Pigmalion&rdquo; is an erotic poem
in the metre of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and Joseph Hall attached a
rather clumsy epigram to every copy that was exposed for sale
in Cambridge. In the same year Marston published, under the
pseudonym of W. Kinsayder, already employed in the earlier
volume, his <i>Scourge of Villanie</i>, eleven satires, in the sixth of
which he asserted that Pigmalion was intended to parody the
amorous poetry of the time. Both this volume and its predecessor
were burnt by order of the archbishop of Canterbury. The
satires, in which Marston avowedly took Persius as his model,
are coarse and vigorous. In addition to a general attack on the
vices of his age he avenges himself on Joseph Hall who had
assailed him in <i>Virgidemiae</i>. He had a great reputation among
his contemporaries. John Weever couples his name with Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s in an epigram; Francis Meres in <i>Palladis tamia</i> (1598)
mentions him among the satirists; a long passage is devoted to
&ldquo;Monsieur Kinsayder&rdquo; in the <i>Return from Parnassus</i> (1606),
and Dr Brinsley Nicholson has suggested that <i>Furor poeticus</i>
in that piece may be a satirical portrait of him. But his invective
by its general tone, goes far to justify Mr W. J. Courthope&rsquo;s<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
judgment that &ldquo;it is likely enough that in seeming to satirize
the world without him, he is usually holding up the mirror to his
own prurient mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 28th of September 1599 Henslowe notices in his diary
that he lent &ldquo;unto Mr Maxton, the new poete, the sum of forty
shillings,&rdquo; as an advance on a play which is not named. Another
hand has amended &ldquo;Maxton&rdquo; to &ldquo;Mastone.&rdquo; The earliest
plays to which Marston&rsquo;s name is attached are <i>The History of
Antonio and Mellida. The First Part</i>; and <i>Antonio&rsquo;s Revenge.
The Second Part</i> (both entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall in 1601 and
printed 1602). The second part is preceded by a prologue which,
in its gloomy forecast of the play, moved the admiration of
Charles Lamb, who also compares the situation of Andrugio and
Lucia to Lear and Kent, but the scene which he quotes gives a
misleading idea of the play and of the general tenor of Marston&rsquo;s
work.</p>

<p>The melodrama and the exaggerated expression of these two
plays offered an opportunity to Ben Jonson, who had already
twice ridiculed Marston, and now pilloried him as Crispinus in
<i>The Poetaster</i> (1601). The quarrel was patched up, for Marston
dedicated his <i>Malcontent</i> (1604) to Jonson, and in the next year
he prefixed commendatory verses to <i>Sejanus</i>. Far greater
restraint is shown in <i>The Malcontent</i> than in the earlier plays.
It was printed twice in 1604, the second time with additions by
John Webster. <i>The Dutch Courtezan</i> (1605) and <i>Parasitaster,
or the Fawne</i> (1606) followed. In 1605 <i>Eastward Hoe</i>,<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> a gay
comedy of London life, which gave offence to the king&rsquo;s Scottish
friends, caused the playwrights concerned in its production&mdash;Marston,
Chapman and Jonson&mdash;to be imprisoned at the instance
of Sir James Murray. <i>The Wonder of Women, or the Tragedie of
Sophonisba</i> (1606), seems to have been put forward by Marston
as a model of what could be accomplished in tragedy. In the
preface he mocks at those authors who make a parade of their
authorities and their learning, and the next play, <i>What you Will</i>
(printed 1607; but probably written much earlier), contains a
further attack on Jonson. The tragedy of <i>The Insatiate
Countesse</i> was printed in 1613, and again, this time anonymously,
in 1616. It was not included in the collected edition of Marston&rsquo;s
plays in 1633, and in the Duke of Devonshire&rsquo;s library there is
a copy bearing the name of William Barksteed, the author of
the poems, <i>Myrrha, the Mother of Adonis</i> (1607), and <i>Hiren and
the Fair Greek</i> (1611). The piece contains many passages
superior to anything to be found in Marston&rsquo;s well-authenticated
plays, and Mr A. H. Bullen suggests that it may be Barksteed&rsquo;s
version of an earlier one drafted by Marston. The character
and history of Isabella are taken chiefly from &ldquo;The Disordered
Lyfe of the Countess of Celant&rdquo; in William Paynter&rsquo;s <i>Palace
of Pleasure</i>, derived eventually from Bandello. There is no
certain evidence of Marston&rsquo;s authorship in <i>Histriomastix</i>
(printed 1610, but probably produced before 1599), or in <i>Jacke
Drums Entertainement, or the Comedie of Pasquil and Katherine</i>
(1616), though he probably had a hand in both. Mr R. Boyle
(<i>Englische Studien</i>, vol. xxx., 1901), in a critical study of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, assigns to Marston&rsquo;s hand the
whole of the action dealing with Hector, with the prologue and
epilogue, and attributes to him the bombast and coarseness in
the last scenes of the play. It will be seen that his undoubted
dramatic work was completed in 1607. It is uncertain at
what time he exchanged professions, but in 1616 he was presented
to the living of Christchurch, Hampshire. He formally resigned
his charge in 1631, and when his works were collected in 1633
the publisher, William Sheares, stated that the author &ldquo;in his
autumn and declining age&rdquo; was living &ldquo;far distant from this
place.&rdquo; Nevertheless he died in London, in the parish of Aldermanbury,
on the 25th of June 1634. He was buried in the
Temple Church.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Marston&rsquo;s works were first published in 1633, once anonymously
as <i>Tragedies and Comedies</i>, and then in the same year as <i>Workes
of Mr John Marston</i>. <i>The Works of John Marston</i> (3 vols.) were
reprinted by Mr J. O. Halliwell (Phillipps) in 1856, and again by
Mr. A. H. Bullen (3 vols.) in 1887. His <i>Poems</i> (2 vols.) were edited by
Dr A. B. Grosart in 1879. The British Museum Catalogue tentatively
assigns to Marston <i>The Whipper of the Satyre his pennance in a
white sheete; or, the Beadle&rsquo;s Confutation</i> (1601), a pamphlet in answer
to <i>The Whipping of the Satyre</i>. For an account of the quarrel of

<p><span class="bold">MARSTON, PHILIP BOURKE<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (1850-1887), English poet, was
born in London on the 13th of August 1850. His father, <span class="sc">John
Westland Marston</span> (1819-1890), of Lincolnshire origin, the
friend of Dickens, Macready and Charles Kean, was the author of
a series of metrical dramas which held the stage in succession
to the ambitious efforts of John Tobin, Talfourd, Bulwer and
Sheridan Knowles. His chief plays were <i>The Patrician&rsquo;s
Daughter</i> (1841), <i>Strathmore</i> (1849), <i>A Hard Struggle</i> (1858) and
<i>Donna Diana</i> (1863). He was looked up to as the upholder of
the outworn tradition of the acted poetic drama, but his plays
showed little vitality, and Marston&rsquo;s reviews for the <i>Athenaeum</i>,
including one of Swinburne&rsquo;s <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>, and his
dramatic criticisms embodied in <i>Our Recent Actors</i> (1888) will
probably claim a more enduring reputation. His <i>Dramatic and
Poetical Works</i> were collected in 1876. The son, Philip Bourke,
was born in a literary atmosphere. His sponsors were Philip
James Bailey and Dinah Mulock (Mrs Craik). At his father&rsquo;s
house near Chalk Farm he met authors and actors of his father&rsquo;s
generation, and subsequently the Rossettis, Swinburne, Arthur
O&rsquo;Shaughnessy and Irving. From his earliest years his literary
precocity was overshadowed by misfortunes. In his fourth year,
in part owing to an accident, his sight began to decay, and he
gradually became almost totally blind. His mother died in 1870.
His <i>fiancée</i>, Mary Nesbit, died in 1871; his closest friend, Oliver
Madox Brown, in 1874; his sister Cicely, his amanuensis, in
1878; in 1879 his remaining sister, Eleanor, who was followed
to the grave after a brief interval by her husband, the
poet O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, and her two children. In 1882 the death
of his chief poetic ally and inspirer, Rossetti, was followed
closely by the tragedy of another kindred spirit, the sympathetic
pessimist, James Thomson (&ldquo;B. V.&rdquo;), who was carried
dying from his blind friend&rsquo;s rooms, where he had sought
refuge from his latest miseries early in June of the same year.
It is said that Marston came to dread making new friendships,
for fear of evil coming to the recipients of his affection. In the
face of such calamities it is not surprising that Marston&rsquo;s verse
became more and more sorrowful and melancholy. The idylls
of flower-life, such as the early and very beautiful &ldquo;The Rose
and the Wind&rdquo; were succeeded by dreams of sleep and the repose
of death. These qualities and gradations of feeling, reflecting
the poet&rsquo;s successive ideals of action and quiescence, are traceable
through his three published collections, <i>Songtide</i> (1871), <i>All in
All</i> (1875) and <i>Wind Voices</i> (1883). The first and third, containing
his best work, went out of print, but Marston&rsquo;s verse was
collected in 1892 by Mrs Louise Chandler Moulton, a loyal and
devoted friend, and herself a poet. Marston read little else but
poetry; and of poetic values, especially of the intenser order,
his judgment could not be surpassed in sensitiveness. He was
saturated with Rossetti and Swinburne, and his imitative power
was remarkable. In his later years he endeavoured to make
money by writing short stories in <i>Home Chimes</i> and other
American magazines, through the agency of Mrs Chandler
Moulton. His popularity in America far exceeded that in his
own country. His health showed signs of collapse from 1883;
in January 1887 he lost his voice, and suffered intensely from the
failure to make himself understood. He died on the 13th of
February 1887.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He was commemorated in Dr Gordon Hake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blind Boy,&rdquo; and
in a fine sonnet by Swinburne, beginning &ldquo;The days of a man are
threescore years and ten.&rdquo; There is an intimate sketch of the blind
poet by a friend, Mr Coulson Kernahan, in <i>Sorrow and Song</i> (1894),
p. 127.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSTON MOOR, BATTLE OF,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> was fought on the 2nd of July
1644 on a moor (now enclosed) seven miles west of York, between
the Royalist army under Prince Rupert and the Parliamentary
and Scottish armies under the earl of Manchester, Lord Fairfax
and Lord Leven. For the operations that preceded the battle see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Great Rebellion</a></span>. Rupert had relieved York and joined
forces with the marquess of Newcastle&rsquo;s army that had defended
that city, and the Parliamentarians and Scots who had besieged
it had drawn off south-westward followed by the Royalists. On
the morning of the 2nd of July, however, Rupert&rsquo;s attack on
their rearguard forced them to halt and deploy on rising ground
on the south edge of the moor, their position being defined on the
right and left by Long Marston and Tockwith and divided from
the Royalist army on the moor by a lane connecting these two
villages. The respective forces were&mdash;Royalists about 18,000,
Parliamentarians and Scots about 27,000. The armies stood
front to front. On the Royalist right was half the cavalry under
Rupert; the infantry was in the centre in two lines and the left
wing of cavalry was under General (Lord) Goring. The lane
along the front was held by skirmishers. On the other side the
cavalry of the Eastern Association under Lieut.-General Cromwell
and that of the Scots under Major-General Leslie (Lord Newark)
formed the left, the infantry of the Eastern Association under
Major-General Crawford, of the Scots under Lord Leven, and of
the Yorkshire Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax was in the
centre and the Yorkshire cavalry under Sir Thomas Fairfax was
on the right wing.</p>

<p>During the afternoon there was a desultory cannonade, but
neither side advanced. At last, concluding from movements in
the enemy&rsquo;s lines that there would be no fighting that day,
Rupert and Newcastle strolled away to their coaches and their
soldiers dismounted and lay down to rest. But seeing this
Cromwell instantly advanced his wing to the attack (5 p.m.).
His dragoons drove away the skirmishers along the lane, and the
line cavalry crossed into the moor. The general forward movement
spread along the Parliamentary line from left to right, the
Eastern Association infantry being the first to cross the road.
In Rupert&rsquo;s momentary absence, the surprised Royalist cavalry
could make no head against Cromwell&rsquo;s charge, although the
latter was only made piecemeal as each unit crossed the lane
and formed to the front. Rupert soon galloped up with his
fresh second line and drove back Cromwell&rsquo;s men, Cromwell himself
being wounded, but Leslie and the Scots Cavalry, taking
ground to their left, swung in upon Rupert&rsquo;s flank, and after a
hard struggle the hitherto unconquered cavalry of the prince
was broken and routed. Then, being unlike other cavalry of the
time, a thoroughly disciplined force, the Eastern Association
cavalry rallied, leaving the pursuit to the Scots light horse. On
the Parliamentary right, Goring had swept away the Yorkshire
horse, and although most of his troopers had followed in disorderly
pursuit, Sir Charles Lucas with some squadrons was
attacking the exposed right of Leven&rsquo;s infantry. At the same
time the Parliamentary infantry had mostly crossed the lane
and was fighting at close quarters and suffering severely, Newcastle&rsquo;s
north-country &ldquo;White-Coat&rdquo; brigade driving back and
finally penetrating their centre. Lord Leven gave up the battle
as lost and rode away to Tadcaster. But the Scots on the right
of the foot held firm against Lucas&rsquo;s attacks, and Cromwell and
Leslie with their cavalry passed along the rear of the Royal army,
guided by Sir Thomas Fairfax (who though wounded in the
rout of his Yorkshire horse had made his way to the other
flank). Then, on the ground where Goring had routed Fairfax,
Cromwell and Leslie won an easy victory over Goring&rsquo;s scattered
and disordered horsemen. The Eastern Association infantry
had followed the horse and was now in rear of the Royalists.
The original Parliamentary centre of foot, a remnant, but one
containing only the bravest and steadiest men, held fast, and
soon the Royalist infantry was broken up into isolated regiments
and surrounded by the victorious horse and foot of the enemy.
The White-Coats retreated into an enclosure and there defended
themselves to the last man. The rest were cut down on the field
or scattered in the pursuit and at nightfall the Royalist army had
ceased to exist. Some of Rupert&rsquo;s foot regiments made their
way to York, but the dispirited garrison only held out for a fortnight.
Rupert rallied some six thousand of the men and escaped
over the hills into Lancashire, thence rejoining King Charles in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page778" id="page778"></a>778</span>
the south. But the Northern army, the main hope of the

<p><span class="bold">MARSUPIALIA<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>marsupium</i>, a &ldquo;pouch,&rdquo; or &ldquo;bag&rdquo;),
the group of mammals in which the young are usually carried for
some time after birth in a pouch on the under-surface of the
body of the female. The group, which has also the alternative
title of Didelphia, is by some authorities regarded as a sub-class
of the mammalia of equal rank with the Monotremata, while by
others it is brigaded with the placentals, so that the two together
form a sub-class of equal grade with the one represented
by the monotremes. There is much to be urged in favour of either
view; and in adopting the former alternative, it must be borne in
mind that the difference between monotremes and marsupials is
vastly greater than that which separates the latter from placentals.
In elevating the marsupials to the rank of a sub-class the
name Metatheria has been suggested as the title for the higher
grade, with Marsupialia as the designation for the single order
by which they are now represented. It is, however, less liable
to cause confusion, and in many other ways more convenient to
employ the better known term Marsupialia in both senses.</p>

<p>Marsupials may be defined as viviparous (that is non-egg-laying)
mammals, in which the young are born in an imperfect
condition, and almost immediately attached to the teats of
the mammary glands; the latter being generally enclosed in a
pouch, and the front edge of the pelvis being always furnished
with epipubic or &ldquo;marsupial&rdquo; bones. As a rule there is no
allantoic placenta forming the means of communication between
the blood of the parent and the foetus, and when such a structure
does occur its development is incomplete. In all cases a more or
less full series of teeth is developed, these being differentiated into
incisors, canines, premolars and molars, when all are present;
but only a single pair of teeth in each jaw has deciduous
predecessors.</p>

<p>The pouch from which the marsupials take their name is
supported by the two epipubic bones, but does not correspond to
the temporary breeding-pouch of the monotremes. It may open
either forward or backwards; and although present in the great
majority of the species, and enclosing the teats, it may, as in
many of the opossums, be completely absent, when the teats
extend in two rows along the whole length of the under-surface of
the body. Whether a pouch is present or not, the young are
born in an exceedingly imperfect state of development, after
a very short period of gestation, and are immediately transferred
by the female parent to the teats, where they remain firmly
attached for a considerable time; the milk being injected into
their mouths at intervals by means of a special muscle which
compresses the glands. In the case of the great grey kangaroo,
for instance, the period of gestation is less than forty days, and
the newly-born embryo, which is blind, naked, and unable to use
its bud-like limbs, is little more than an inch in length.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As additional features of the sub-class may be mentioned the
absence of a corpus callosum connecting the right and left hemispheres
of the brain,<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and of a fossa in the septum between the two
auricles of the heart. In the skull there are always vacuities, or
unossified spaces in the bones of the palate, while the &ldquo;angle,&rdquo; or
lower hind extremity of each half of the lower jaw is strongly bent
inwards so as to form a kind of shelf, and the alisphenoid bone takes
a share in the formation of the tympanum, or auditory bladder, or
bulla. Didelphia, the alternative name of the group was given in
allusion to the circumstance that the uterus has two separate openings;
while other features are the inclusion of the openings of the
alimentary canal and the urino-genital sinus in a common sphincter
muscle, and the position of the scrotum in advance of the penis.
The bandicoots alone possess a placenta. Lastly the number of
trunk-vertebrae is always nineteen, while there are generally thirteen
pairs of ribs.</p>

<p>As regards the teeth, in all cases except the wombats the number
of upper incisors differs from that of the corresponding lower teeth.
As already stated, there is no vertical displacement and succession
of the functional teeth except in the case of a single tooth on each
side of each jaw, which is the third of the premolar series, and is
preceded by a tooth having more or less of the characters of a molar
(see fig. 1). In some cases (as in rat-kangaroos) this tooth retains
its place and function until the animal has nearly, if not quite,
attained its full stature, and is not shed and replaced by its successor
until after all the other teeth, including the molars, are in place and
use. In others, as the thylacine, it is rudimentary, being shed or
absorbed before any of the other teeth have cut the gum, and therefore
functionless. It may be added that there are some marsupials,
such as the wombat, koala, marsupial ant-eater and the dasyures,
in which no such deciduous tooth, even in a rudimentary state, has
been discovered. In addition to this replacement of a single pair
of functional teeth in each jaw, it has been discovered that marsupials
possess rudimentary tooth-germs which never cut the gum. According
to one theory, these rudimentary teeth, together with the one
pair of functional teeth in each jaw that has vertical successors,
represent the milk-teeth of placental mammals. On the other hand,
there are those who believe that the functional dentition (other
than the replacing premolar and the molars) correspond to the
milk-dentition of placentals, and that the rudimentary tooth-germs
represent a &ldquo;prelacteal&rdquo; dentition. The question, however, is of
academic rather than of practical interest, and whichever way it is
answered does not affect our general conception of the nature and
relationships of the group.</p>

<p class="pt2">Unfortunately the homology of the functional series does not by
any means end the uncertainty connected with the marsupial dentition; as there is also a difference of opinion with regard to the serial
homology of some of the cheek-teeth. For instance, according to
the older view, the dental formula in the thylacine or Tasmanian wolf
is i. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c, <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> = 46. On the other hand, in the opinion of the
present writer, this formula, so far as the cheek-teeth are concerned,
should be altered to p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, thus bringing it in accord, so far as
these teeth are concerned, with the placental formula, and making
the single pair of replacing teeth the third premolars. It may be
added that the formula given above shows that the marsupial dentition
may comprise more teeth than the 44 which form the normal
full placental complement.</p>
</div>

<p>As regards geographical distribution, existing marsupials,
with the exception of two families, <i>Didelphyidae</i> and <i>Epanorthidae</i>,
are mainly limited to the Australian region, forming the
chief mammalian fauna of Australia, New Guinea, and some of
the adjacent islands. The <i>Didelphyidae</i> are almost exclusively
Central and South American, only one or two species ranging
into North America. Fossil remains of members of this family
have also been found in Europe in strata of the Oligocene
period.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The origin and evolution of the Australian marsupials
have been discussed by Mr B. A. Bensley. In broad contrast
to the views of Dr A. R. Wallace, this author is of opinion that
marsupials did not effect an entrance into Australia till about
the middle of the Tertiary period, their ancestors being probably
opossums of the American type. They were then arboreal; but
they speedily entered upon a rapid, although short-lived, course
of evolution, during which leaping terrestrial forms like the
kangaroos were developed. The short period of this evolution
is at least one factor in the primitive grade of even the most
specialized members of the group. In the advance of their molar
teeth from a tritubercular to a grinding type, the author traces a
curious parallelism between marsupials and placentals. Taking
opossums to have been the ancestors of the group, the author
considers that the present writer may be right in his view that
marsupials entered Australia from Asia by way of New Guinea.
On the other hand there is nothing absolutely decisive against
their origin being southern.</p>

<p>Again, taking as a text Mr L. Dollo&rsquo;s view that marsupials
were originally arboreal, that, on account of their foot-structure,
they could not have been the ancestors of placentals, and that
they themselves are degenerate placentals, Mr Bensley contrasts
this with Huxley&rsquo;s scheme of mammalian evolution. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page779" id="page779"></a>779</span>
to the latter, the early monotremes which became specialized
into modern monotremes, gave rise to the ancestors of the modern
marsupials; while the modern placentals are likewise an offshoot
from the ancestral marsupial stock. This phylogeny, the author
thinks, is the most probable of all. It is urged that the imperfect
placenta of the bandicoots instead of being vestigial, may be an
instance of parallelism, and that in marsupials generally the
allantois failed to form a placental connexion. Owing to the
antiquity of both placentals and marsupials, the arboreal
character of the feet of the modern forms of the latter is of little
importance. Further, it is considered that too much weight has
been assigned to the characters distinguishing monotremes from
other mammals, foetal marsupials showing a monotreme type
of coracoid, while it is probable that in the long run it will be
found impossible to maintain the essential dissimilarity between
the milk-glands of monotremes and other mammals.</p>

<p>Another view is to regard both marsupials and placentals as
derivates from implacental ancestors more or less nearly related
to the creodont carnivora, or possibly as independently descended
from anomodont reptiles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Creodonta</a></span>). Finally, there is the
hypothesis that marsupials are the descendants of placentals,
in which case, as was suggested by its discoverer, the placenta
of the bandicoots would be a true vestigial structure.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Classification.</i></p>

<p>Existing marsupials may be divided into three main divisions
or sub-orders, of which the first, or Polyprotodontia, is common
to America and Australasia; the second, or Paucituberculata, is
exclusively South American; while the third, or Diprotodonts,
is as solely Australasian inclusive of a few in the eastern
Austro-Malayan islands.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. <i>Polyprotodonts.</i>&mdash;The Polyprotodonts are characterized by
their numerous, small, sub-equal incisors, of which there are either
five or four pairs in the upper and always three in the lower jaw,
(fig. 2) and the generally strong and large canines, as well as by the
presence of from four to five sharp cusps or tubercles on the crown of
the molars. The pouch is often absent, and may open backwards.
For the most part the species are carnivorous or insectivorous.</p>

<p>The first family is that of the true or American opossums&mdash;<i>Didelphyidae</i>,
in which there are five pairs of upper incisors, while
the feet are of the presumed primitive arboreal type, the hind foot
having the four outer toes sub-equal and separate, with the first
opposable to them all. With the exception of the water-opossum,
forming the genus <i>Chironectes</i>, all the living members of the family
may be included in the genus <i>Didelphys</i>. The latter may, however,
be split up into several sub-generic groups, such as <i>Metachirus</i>, <i>Philander</i>,
<i>Marmosa</i> (<i>Micoureus</i> or <i>Grymaeomys</i>), <i>Peramys</i>, <i>Dromiciops</i>, &amp;c.
The small South American forms included in <i>Marmosa</i>, which lack
the pouch, and have numerous teats, and molar teeth of a primitive
type, are doubtless the most generalized representatives of the
group (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Opossum</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Water-Opossum</a></span>).</p>

<p>Nearly allied is the Australian family <i>Dasyuridae</i>, characterized
by the presence of only four pairs of upper incisors, the generally
small and rudimentary condition of the first hind toe, which can but
seldom be opposed to the rest, and the absence of prehensile power
in the tail; the pouch being either present or absent, and the fore
feet always five-toed. The stomach is simple, and there is no caecum
to the intestine, although this is present in the opossums.</p>

<p>The largest representative of the family is the Tasmanian wolf,
or thylacine, alone representing the genus <i>Thylacinus</i>, in which the
dentition numbers i. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> = 46; with the incisors small and
vertical, the outer one in the upper jaw being larger than the others.
Summits of the lower incisors, before they are worn, with a deep
transverse groove, dividing it into an anterior and a posterior cusp.
Canines long, strong and conical. Premolars with compressed
crowns, increasing in size from before backwards. Molars in general
characters resembling those of <i>Sarcophilus</i>, but of more simple form,
the cusps being less distinct and not so sharply pointed. Deciduous
molar very small, and shed before the animal leaves the mother&rsquo;s
pouch. General form dog-like, with the head elongated, the muzzle
pointed, and the ears moderate, erect and triangular. Fur short
and closely applied to the skin. Tail of moderate length, thick at
the base and tapering towards the apex, clothed with short hair.
First hind toe (including the metacarpal bone) absent. Vertebrae:
C. 7, D. 13, L. 6, S. 2, Ca. 23. Marsupial bones unossified. The gradual
passage of the thick root of the tail into the body is a character common
to the Tasmanian wolf and the aard-vark, and may be directly
inherited from reptilian ancestors (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thylacine</a></span>).</p>

<p>The next genus is represented solely by the Tasmanian devil,
<i>Sarcophilus</i> (or <i>Diabolus</i>) <i>ursinus</i>, a medium-sized animal with a
dental formula similar to that of the dasyures, but with teeth (fig. 2)
approximating to those of the thylacine, though markedly different
in details. The first hind toe is absent.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;native cats,&rdquo; or dasyures, constituting the genus <i>Dasyurus</i>,
the dental formula is i. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>: total 42. The upper
incisors are nearly equal and vertical, with the first slightly longer,
narrower, and separated from the rest. Lower incisors sloping
forward and upward. Canines large and sharply pointed. First
two premolars with compressed and sharp-pointed crowns, and
slightly developed anterior and posterior accessory basal cusps.
Molars with numerous sharp-pointed cusps. In the upper jaw the
first two with crowns having a triangular free surface; the last
small, simple, narrow and placed transversely. In the lower jaw
the molars more compressed, with longer cusps; the last not notably
smaller than the others. Ears of moderate size, prominent and
obtusely pointed. First hind toe rudimentary, clawless or absent;
its metatarsal bone always present. Tail generally long and well
clothed with hair. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 6, S. 2, Ca. 18-20 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dasyure</a></span>).</p>

<p>The genus <i>Phascologale</i> comprises a number of small marsupials,
none exceeding a rat in size, differing from the dasyures in possessing
an additional premolar&mdash;the dentition being i. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, p. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>:
total 46&mdash;and in having the teeth generally developed upon an insectivorous
rather than a carnivorous pattern, the upper middle incisors
being larger and inclined forward, the canines relatively smaller,
and the molars with broad crowns, armed with prickly tubercles.
The muzzle is pointed. Ears moderately rounded, and nearly naked.
Fore feet with five sub-equal toes, with compressed, slightly curved
pointed claws. Hind feet with the four outer toes sub-equal, with
claws similar to those in the fore feet; the first toe almost always
distinct and partially opposable, though small and nailless, sometimes
absent.</p>

<p>In some respects intermediate between the preceding and the
next genus is <i>Dasyuroides byrnei</i>, of Central Australia, an animal of
the size of a rat, with one lower premolar less than in <i>Phascologale</i>,
without the first hind toe, and with a somewhat thickened tail.
The pouch is incomplete, with two lateral folds, and the number of
teats six.</p>

<p><i>Sminthopsis</i> includes several very small species, with the same
dental formula as <i>Phascologale</i>, but distinguished from that genus
by the narrowness of the hind foot, in which the first toe is present,
and the granulated or hairy (in place of broad, smooth and naked)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page780" id="page780"></a>780</span>
soles. A pouch is present, and there are eight or ten teats. Nearly
allied is the jumping <i>Antechinomys laniger</i>, of East Central Australia,
an elegant mouse-like creature, with large oval ears, elongated limbs,
a long and tufted tail and no first hind toe. In connexion with the
large size of the ears is the excessive inflation of the auditory bulla
of the skull.</p>

<p>From all other members of the family the marsupial, or banded,
ant-eater (<i>Myrmecobius fasciatus</i>) differs by the presence of more
than seven pairs of cheek-teeth in each jaw, as well as by the
exceedingly long and protrusile tongue. Hence it is made the type
of a distinct sub-family, the <i>Myrmecobiinae</i>, as distinct from the
<i>Dasyurinae</i>, which includes all the other members of the family.
From the number of its cheek-teeth, the banded ant-eater has been
regarded as related to some of the primitive Jurassic mammals;
but this view is disputed by Mr Bensley, who regards this multiplicity
of teeth as a degenerate feature. On the other hand, it is noteworthy
that this marsupial retains in its lower jaw the so-called mylo-hyoid
groove, which is found in the aforesaid Jurassic mammals. <i>Myrmecobius</i>
has a total of 52 or 54 teeth, which may be classed as i. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>,
p. + m. <span class="f80">(8 or 9) / (8 or 9)</span>. The teeth are all small and (except the four posterior
inferior molars) separated from each other by an interval.
Head elongated, but broad behind; muzzle long and pointed; ears
of moderate size, ovate and rather pointed. Fore-feet with five toes,
all having strong pointed, compressed claws, the second, third and
fourth nearly equal, the fifth somewhat and the first considerably
shorter. Hind-feet with no trace of first toe externally, but the
metatarsal bone is present. Tail long, clothed with long hairs.
Fur rather harsh and bristly. Female without pouch, the young
when attached to the nipples being concealed by the long hair of the
abdomen. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 6, S. 3, Ca. 23.
The single species, which is a native of western and southern Australia,
is about the size of an English squirrel, to which its long bushy tail
gives it some resemblance; but it lives entirely on the ground, especially
in sterile sandy districts, feeding on ants. Its prevailing colour
is chestnut-red, but the hinder part of the back is marked with
broad, white, transverse bands on a dark ground.</p>

the upper incisors being small, with short, broad crowns; the lower
incisors moderate, narrow, proclivous; canines well developed.
Premolars compressed, pointed; and the molars with quadrate
tuberculated crowns. Deciduous premolar preceded by a minute
molariform tooth, which remains in place until the animal is nearly
full grown. Fore feet with two or three of the middle toes of nearly
equal size, and provided with strong, sharp, slightly curved claws,
the other toes rudimentary. Hind feet long and narrow; the first
toe rudimentary or absent; the second and third very slender and
united in a common integument; the fourth very large, with a stout
elongated conical claw; the fifth smaller than the fourth (see fig. 6).
The terminal phalanges of the large toes of both feet cleft at their
extremities. Head elongated, with the muzzle long, narrow and

complete, generally opening backwards. Alone among marsupials
bandicoots have no clavicles. More remarkable still is the

longer with inner toe represented only by a
small metatarsal bone. Muzzle much elongated and
narrow. Fur soft and silky. Ears very large, long

metacarpals and short, sharp, slightly curved, compressed
claws. First toe represented by a minute
rudiment of a metacarpal bone; the fourth by a
metacarpal and two small phalanges without a claw,
and not reaching the middle of the metacarpal of
the third; fifth entirely absent. Hind foot long and
narrow, mainly composed of the strongly developed
fourth toe, terminating in a conical pointed nail,
with a strong pad behind it; the first toe represented
by a rudimentary metatarsal; the remaining
toes completely developed, with claws, but exceedingly
slender; the united second and third reaching
a little way beyond the metatarso-phalangeal articulation
of the fourth; the fifth somewhat shorter.
Tail not quite so long as the body, and covered
with short hairs. Ears large and pointed, and
folded down when the animal is at rest. Fur soft
and loose. Pouch opening backwards. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 6,
S. 1, Ca. 20.</p>

<p>The only species of this genus is about the size of a small rat,
found in the interior of Australia. Its general habits and food appear
to resemble those of other bandicoots. A separate family, <i>Notoryctidae</i>,
is represented by the marsupial mole (<i>Notoryctes typhlops</i>),
of the deserts of south Central Australia, a silky, golden-haired,
burrowing creature, with a curious leathery muzzle, and a short,
naked stumpy tail. The limbs are five-toed, with the third and
fourth toes of the front pair armed with enormous digging claws;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page781" id="page781"></a>781</span>
there are no external ear-conchs; and the dentition includes four pairs
of upper, and three of lower, incisors, and distinctly tritubercular
cheek-teeth. The small pouch, supported by the usual epipubic
bones, opens backwards. In correlation with its burrowing habits,
some of the vertebrae of the neck and of the loins are respectively
welded together. The eyes have degenerated to a greater extent than
those of any other burrowing mammal, the retina being reduced to a
mass of simple cells, and the cornea and sclerotic (&ldquo;white&rdquo;) to a pear-shaped
fibrous capsule enclosing a ball of pigment. The reason for
this extreme degeneration is probably to be found in the sandy nature
of the soil in which the creature burrows, a substance which would
evidently irritate and inflame any functional remnant of an eye.
The portion of the lachrymal duct communicating with the cavity
of the nose has, on the other hand, been abnormally developed,
apparently for the purpose of cleansing that chamber from particles
of sand which may obtain an entrance while the animal is burrowing.

<p>2. <i>Paucituberculates.</i>&mdash;The second sub-order of marsupials, the
Paucituberculata, is exclusively South American, and typically
represented by the family <i>Epanorthidae</i>, the majority of the members
of which are extinct, their remains being found in the probably
Miocene Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia, although one existing genus
(<i>Caenolestes</i>) survives in Ecuador and Colombia. One of the two
living species was, indeed, described so long ago as the year 1863,
under the preoccupied name of <i>Hyracodon</i>, but attracted little or
no attention, as its affinities were not fully recognized. Externally
<i>Caenolestes</i> has a shrew-like appearance. The elongated skull
(fig. 8) has four pairs of upper incisors and long upper canines,
while in the lower jaw there is a single pair of procumbent incisors,
followed by several small teeth representing the canine and earlier
premolars. The three pairs of molars in each jaw are, like the last
premolar, quadritubercular oblong teeth. The five-toed feet are
of normal structure, and the rat-like tail is prehensile towards the
tip. The female has a small pouch. The extinct members of the
family are represented by the genera <i>Epanorthus</i>, <i>Acdestis</i>, <i>Garzonia</i>,
&amp;c. In a second family&mdash;<i>Abderitidae</i>&mdash;also from the Patagonian
Miocene, the penultimate premolar is developed into an enormous
tooth, with a tall, secant and grooved crown, somewhat after the
fashion of the enlarged premolar of <i>Plagiaulax</i>. From the structure
of the skull, it is thought probable that <i>Abderites</i> had an elongated
snout, like that of many Insectivora. As a sub-order, the
Paucituberculata are characterized by the presence of four pairs of
upper and three of lower incisor teeth; the enlargement and forward
inclination of the first pair of lower incisors, and the presence of four
or five sharp cusps on the cheek-teeth, coupled with the absence of
&ldquo;syndactylism&rdquo; in the hind limbs.</p>

<p>3. <i>Diprotodonts.</i>&mdash;The third and last sub-order of marsupials is
the Diprotodontia, which is exclusively Australasian and includes
the wombats, koala, cuscuses, kangaroos and their relatives. There
are never more than three pairs of upper and one of lower incisors,
of which the middle upper and the single lower pair are large and
chisel-like (fig. 9); the canines are small or absent; the cheek-teeth
have bluntly tuberculate or transversely-ridged crowns in most
cases; and the hind-feet are syndactylous. With one exception,
the intestine has a caecum, and the pouch is large and opens forwards.
It should be added that Professor Elliot Smith has pointed
out a certain peculiarity in its commissures whereby the brain of
the diprotodonts differs markedly from that of the polyprotodonts
and approximates to the placental type. Dr Einar Lönnberg has
also recorded certain adaptive peculiarities in the stomach. Most
of the species, particularly the specialized types, are more or less
completely herbivorous.</p>

<p>The first family, <i>Phascolomyidae</i>, is typified by the wombats;
but according to the view adopted by Mr H. Winge, and endorsed
by Professor Max Weber, is also taken to include the koala. In this
wider sense the family may be characterized as follows. The tympanic
process of the alisphenoid bone of the skull is short, not covering
the cavity of the tympanum, nor reaching the paroccipital
process. The tail is rudimentary, the first hind-toe opposable, the
first pair of upper incisors very large, but the second and third either
absent or small and placed partially behind the larger pair; and only
five pairs of cheek-teeth in each jaw. The stomach has a cardiac
gland, and the number of teats is two.</p>

<p>In the wombats (<i>Phascolomys</i>) the dentition is i. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, c. <span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>, p. + m. <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span>,
total 24; all the teeth growing from persistent pulps, and the incisors
large and chisel-like, with enamel only on the front surface. The
cheek-teeth strongly curved, forming from the base to the summit
about a quarter of a circle, the concavity being directed outwards
in the upper and inwards in the lower teeth. The first of the series
(which appears to have no predecessor) single-lobed; the other four
composed of two lobes, each subtriangular in section. Limbs equal,
stout and short. Fore-feet with five distinct toes, each furnished
with a long, strong and slightly curved nail, the first and fifth considerably
shorter than the other three. Hind-feet with a very short nailless
first toe, the second, third and fourth toes partially united by
integument, of nearly equal length, the fifth distinct and rather
shorter; all four with long and curved nails. In the skeleton the
second and third toes are distinctly more slender than the fourth,
showing a tendency towards the character so marked in the following
families. Tail rudimentary. Caecum very short and wide, with a
vermiform appendage (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wombat</a></span>).</p>

<p>In addition to remains referable to the existing genus, the Pleistocene
deposits of Australia have yielded evidence of an extinct giant
wombat constituting the genus <i>Phascolonus</i> (<i>Sceparnodon</i>).</p>

much larger than the others, with a bevelled cutting edge (fig. 9).
Canine very small; a considerable interval between it and the first
premolar, which is as long from before backwards but not so broad
as the molars, and has a cutting edge, with a smaller parallel inner
ridge. The molar-like teeth slightly diminishing in size from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page782" id="page782"></a>782</span>
first to the fourth, with square crowns, each bearing four pyramidal
cusps. The lower incisors are partially inclined forwards, compressed
and tapering, bevelled at the ends. Cheek-teeth in continuous
series, as in the upper jaw. Fore-feet with the two inner toes slightly
separated from and opposable to the remaining three, all with strong
curved and much compressed claws. Hind-foot (fig. 10) with the
first toe placed far back, large
and broad, the second and third
(united) toes considerably smaller
than the other two; the fourth the
largest. No external tail. Fur dense

D. 11, L. 8, S. 2, Ca. 8. Ribs eleven
pairs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Koala</a></span>).</p>

<p>Here may be noticed three genera
of large extinct marsupials from
the Pleistocene of Australia whose
affinities appear to ally them to
the wombat-group on the one hand
and to the phalangers on the other.
The longest known is <i>Diprotodon</i>,
an animal of the size of a rhinoceros,
with a dental formula of i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, c. <span class="spp">0</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>,
p. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, m. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, total 28. The first upper
incisor very large and chisel-like,
molars with prominent transverse
ridges, as in <i>Macropus</i>, but without
the longitudinal connecting ridge.
Complete skeletons disinterred by
Dr E. C. Stirling indicate that in the
structure of the feet this creature
presents resemblances both to the
wombats and the phalangers, but
is nearer to the former than to the latter. On the other hand,
the considerably smaller <i>Nototherium</i>, characterized by its sharp
and broad skull and smaller incisors, seems to have been much more
wombat-like, and may perhaps have possessed similar burrowing
habits.</p>

<p>The last of the three is <i>Thylacoleo carnifex</i>, so named on account
of its supposed carnivorous habits. In the adult the dentition
(fig. 11) is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, c. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">0</span>, p. + m. <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, total 24. The first upper incisor is much
larger than the others; canine and first two premolars rudimentary.
In the lower jaw there are also one or two small and early deciduous
premolars; third premolars of both jaws formed on the same type
as that of the rat-kangaroos, but relatively much larger; molars
rudimentary, tubercular. The functional teeth are reduced to one
pair of large cutting incisors situated close to the middle line, and
one great, cutting, compressed premolar, on each side above and
below. As already mentioned, <i>Thylacoleo</i> was originally regarded
as a carnivorous creature, but this view was subsequently disputed,
and its diet supposed to consist of soft roots, bulbs and fruits, with
an occasional small bird or mammal. Recently, however, the
pendulum of opinion has swung back towards the original view:
and Dr R. Broom believes <i>Thylacoleo</i> to have been &ldquo;a purely carnivorous
animal, and one which would be quite able to, and probably
did, kill animals as large or larger than itself.&rdquo; The affinities of
the creature are clearly with the phalangers.</p>

<p>By means of the little musk-kangaroo, the cuscuses and phalangers
constituting the family <i>Phalangeridae</i>, are so closely connected with
the kangaroos, or <i>Macropodidae</i>, that in the opinion of some naturalists
they ought all to be included in a single family, with three
sub-families. Theoretically, no doubt, this is correct, but the typical
members of the two groups are so different from one another that,
as a matter of convenience, the retention of the two families seems
advisable. From the <i>Phascolomyidae</i>, the two families, which may
be collectively designated Phalangeroidea, differ by the circumstance
that in the skull the tympanic process of the alisphenoid covers
the tympanic cavity and reaches the paroccipital process. The tail
is long and in some cases prehensile; the first hind-toe may be either
large, small or absent; the dentition usually includes three pairs
of upper and one of lower incisors, and six or seven pairs of cheek-teeth
in each jaw; the stomach is either simple or sacculated, without
a cardiac gland; and there are four teats.</p>

<p>With the exception of the aberrant long-snouted phalanger, the
members of the family <i>Phalangeridae</i> have the normal number of
functional incisors, in addition to which there may be one or two
rudimentary pairs in the lower jaw. The first in the upper jaw is
strong, curved and cutting, the other two generally somewhat
smaller; the single lower functional incisor large, more or less
inclined forwards; canines <span class="f80">1 / (1 or 0)</span> upper small or moderate, conical
and sharp-pointed; lower absent or rudimentary; premolars
variable; molars <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, or <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>, with four obtuse tubercles, sometimes
forming crescents. Limbs subequal. Fore-feet with five distinct
subequal toes with claws. Hind-feet short and broad, with five well-developed
toes; the first large, nailless and opposable; the second
and third slender and united by a common integument as far as
the claws. Caecum present (except in <i>Tarsipes</i>), and usually large.
The lower jaw has no pocket on the outer side. All are animals of
small or moderate size and arboreal habits, feeding on a vegetable
or mixed diet, and inhabiting Australia, Papua and the Moluccan
Islands.</p>

<p>As the first example of the group may be taken the elegant little
long-snouted phalanger (<i>Tarsipes rostratus</i>, fig. 12), a west Australian
creature of the size of a mouse, which may be regarded as representing
by itself a sub-family (<i>Tarsipediinae</i>), characterized by the rudimentary
teeth, the long and extensile tongue, and absence of a
caecum. The head is elongated, with a slender muzzle and the
mouth-opening small. The two lower incisors are long, very slender,
sharp-pointed and horizontally placed. All the other teeth are
simple, conical, minute and placed at considerable and irregular
intervals apart in the jaws, the number appearing to vary in different
individuals and even on different sides of the jaw of the same individuals.
The formula in one specimen was i. <span class="f80">(2 &minus; 2) / (1 &minus; 1)</span>, c. <span class="f80">(1 &minus; 1) / (0 &minus; 0)</span>,
p. + m. <span class="f80">(3 &minus; 4) / (2 &minus; 3)</span>; total 20. The lower jaw is slender, nearly straight,
and without a coronoid process or inflected angle. Fore-feet with
five well-developed toes, carrying small, flat, scale-like nails, not
reaching the extremity of the digits. Hind-feet rather long and
slender, with a well-developed opposable and nailless first toe;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page783" id="page783"></a>783</span>
second and third digits united, with sharp, compressed curved
claws; the fourth and fifth free, with small flat nails. Ears of
moderate size and rounded. Tail longer than the body and head,
scantily clothed with short hairs, prehensile. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13,
L. 5, S. 3. Ca. 24.</p>

<p>As indicated in the accompanying illustration, the long-snouted
phalanger is arboreal in habits, extracting honey and probably
small insects from long-tubed flowers by means of its extensile
tongue.</p>

<p>The remaining members of the family may be included in the
sub family <i>Phalangerinae</i>, characterized by the normal nature of the
dentition (which shows rudimentary lower canines) and tongue.
Cuscuses and phalangers form a numerous group, all the members
of which are arboreal, and some of which are provided with lateral
expansions of skin enabling them to glide from tree to tree like
flying-squirrels. The typical members of the group are the cuscuses
(<i>Phalanger</i>), ranging from the Moluccas and Celebes to New Guinea,
in which the males are often different in colour from the females.
The true phalangers, or opossums of the colonists, constitute the
genus <i>Trichosurus</i>, while the ring-tailed species are known as <i>Pseudochirus</i>;
the latter ranging to New Guinea. <i>Dactylopsila</i> is easily
recognized by its attenuated fourth finger and parti-coloured fur;
the flying species are classed as <i>Petauroides</i>, <i>Petaurus</i>, <i>Gymnobelideus</i>
and <i>Acrobates</i>, the last no larger than a mouse; while Dromicia,
<i>Distaechurus</i> and <i>Acrobates</i> are allied types without parachutes (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phalanger</a></span>).</p>

<p>An equally brief notice must suffice of the kangaroo tribe or
<i>Macropodidae</i>, since these receive a special notice elsewhere.
The dentition is i. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span> c. <span class="f80">(0 or 1) / 0</span> p. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> m. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>; the incisors being sharp and cutting,
and those of the lower jaw frequently having a scissor-like action
against one another. The broad molars are either bluntly tuberculated
or transversely ridged; the outer side of the hind part of
the lower jaw has a deep pocket; and the hind-limbs are generally
very long, with the structure of the foot similar to that of the bandicoots.
The family is connected with the <i>Phalangeridae</i> by means
of the musk-kangaroo (<i>Hypsiprymnodon moschatus</i>); forming the
sub-family <i>Hypsiprymnodontinae</i>. Then come the rat-kangaroos,
or kangaroo-rats, constituting the sub-family <i>Potoroinae</i>; while the
tree-kangaroos (<i>Dendrolagus</i>), rock-wallabies (<i>Petrogale</i>), and wallabies
and kangaroos (<i>Macropus</i>) form the <i>Macropodinae</i> (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Kangaroo</a></span>).</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><i>Extinct Marsupials</i></p>

<p>Reference has been made to the Australasian Pleistocene genera
<i>Phascolonus</i>, <i>Diprotodon</i>, <i>Nototherium</i> and <i>Thylacoleo</i>, whose affinities
are with the wombats and phalangers. The same deposits have also
yielded remains of extinct types of kangaroo, some of gigantic size,
constituting the genera <i>Sthenurus</i>, <i>Procoptodon</i> and <i>Palorchestes</i>.
Numerous types more or less nearly allied to the phalangers, such
as <i>Burramys</i> and <i>Triclis</i> have also been described, as well as a flying
form, <i>Polaeopetaurus</i>. It is also interesting to note that fossil
remains indicate the former occurrence of thylacines and Tasmanian
devils on the Australian mainland. Of more interest is the imperfectly
known <i>Wynyardia</i>, from older Tertiary beds in Tasmania,
which apparently presents points of affinity both to phalangers
and dasyures. From the Oligocene deposits of France and southern
England have been obtained numerous remains of opossums referable
to the American family <i>Didelphyidae</i>. These ancient opossums
have been separated generically from <i>Didelphys</i> (in its widest sense)
on account of certain differences in the relative sizes of the lower
premolars, but as nearly the whole of the species have been formed
on lower jaws, of which some hundreds have been found, it is impossible
to judge how far these differences are correlated with other
dental or osteological characters. In the opinion of Dr H. Filhol,
the fossils themselves represent two genera, <i>Peratherium</i>, containing
the greater part of the species, about twenty in number, and <i>Amphiperatherium</i>,
with three species only. All are comparatively small
animals, few of them exceeding the size of a rat.</p>

<p>Besides these interesting European fossils, a certain number of
didelphian bones have been found in the caves of Brazil, but these
are either closely allied to or identical with the species now living
in the same region.</p>

<p>The occurrence in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia of fossil
marsupials allied to the living <i>Caenolestes</i> has been mentioned above.
The alleged occurrence in the same beds of marsupials allied to the
thylacine is based on remains now more generally regarded as referable
to the creodont carnivores (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Creodonta</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Mesozoic Mammals.</i>&mdash;Under the heading of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Multituberculata</a></span>
will be found a brief account of certain extinct mammals from the
Mesozoic formations of Europe and North America which have been
regarded as more or less nearly related to the monotremes. The
same deposits have yielded remains of small mammals whose dentition
approximates more nearly to that of either polyprotodont
marsupials or insectivores; and these may be conveniently noticed
here without prejudice to their true affinities. Before proceeding
further it may be mentioned that the remains of many of these
mammals are very scarce, even in formations apparently in every
way suitable to the preservation of such fossils, and it hence seems
probable that these creatures are stragglers from a country where
primitive small mammals were abundant. Not improbably this
country was either &ldquo;Gondwana-land,&rdquo; connecting Mesozoic India
with Africa, or perhaps Africa itself. At any rate, there seems little
doubt that it was the region where creodonts and other primitive
mammals were first differentiated from their reptilian ancestors.</p>

<p>Of the Old World forms, the family
<i>Triconodontidae</i> is typified by the genus
<i>Triconodon</i>, from the English Purbeck, in
which the cheek-teeth carry three cutting
cusps arranged longitudinally.
There seems to have been a replacement
of some of these teeth; and it
has been suggested that this was of
the marsupial type. To the same family
are referred <i>Phascolotherium</i> (fig. 14), of
the Lower Jurassic Stonesfield slate of
England, and <i>Spalacotherium</i> (fig. 15),
of the Dorsetshire Purbeck; the latter having the three cusps of
the cheek-teeth rotated so as to assume a tritubercular type. Other
genera are <i>Menacodon</i> and <i>Priacodon</i>, the former American, and the
latter common to Europe and North America. By one authority
<i>Amphilestes</i> (fig. 16), of the
Stonesfield Slate, is included
in the same group, while by
a second it is regarded as
representing a family by itself.
<i>Amphitherium</i>, of the
Stonesfield Slate, typifies the
family <i>Amphitheriidae</i>, which
includes the American <i>Dryolestes</i>,
and in which some
would class the European Purbeck genus <i>Amblotherium</i>, although
Professor H. F. Osborn has made the last the type of a distinct
family. Yet another family, according to the palaeontologist
last named, is typified by the genus <i>Stylacodon</i>, of the English
Purbeck. To mention the other forms which have received names
will be unnecessary on this occasion.</p>

in the opinion of Mr B. A. Bensley, this is incorrect. It may be
added that the division of these teeth into premolars and molars
in figs. 14 and 16 is based upon the view of Sir R. Owen, and is not
altogether trustworthy, while the restoration of some of the missing
teeth is more or less conjectural. As regards the affinities of the
creatures to which these jaws belonged, Professor Osborn has referred
the <i>Triconodontidae</i> and <i>Amphitheriidae</i>, together with the Curtodontidae
(as represented by the English Purbeck <i>Curtodon</i>), to a
primitive group of marsupials, while he has assigned the <i>Amblotheriidae</i>
and <i>Stylacodontidae</i> to an ancestral assemblage of Insectivora.
On the other hand, in the opinion of Professor H. Winge, a large
number of these creatures are primitive monotremes. Besides the
above, in the Trias of North America we have <i>Dromotherium</i> and
<i>Microconodon</i>, extremely primitive forms, representing the family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page784" id="page784"></a>784</span>
<i>Dromotheriidae</i>, and apparently showing decided traces of reptilian
affinity. It may be added that a few traces of mammals have been
obtained from the English Wealden, among which an incisor tooth
foreshadows the rodent type.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARSYAS,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> in Greek mythology, a Phrygian god or Silenus,
son of Hyagnis. He was originally the god of the small river
of the same name near Celaenae, an old Phrygian town. He
represents the art of playing the flute as opposed to the lyre&mdash;the
one the accompaniment of the worship of Cybele, the other that
of the worship of Apollo. According to the legend, Athena, who
had invented the flute, threw it away in disgust, because it
distorted the features. Marsyas found it, and having acquired
great skill in playing it, challenged Apollo to a contest with his
lyre. Midas, king of Phrygia, who had been appointed judge,
declared in favour of Marsyas, and Apollo punished Midas by
changing his ears into ass&rsquo;s ears. In another version, the Muses
were judges and awarded the victory to Apollo, who tied Marsyas
to a tree and flayed him alive. Marsyas, as well as Midas and
Silenus, are associated in legend with Dionysus and belong to
the cycle of legends of Cybele. A statue of Marsyas was set
up in the Roman forum and colonies as a symbol of liberty.
The contest and punishment of Marsyas were favourite subjects
in Greek art, both painting and sculpture. In Florence there
are several statues of Marsyas hanging on the tree as he is going
to be flayed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Greek Art</a></span>, fig. 54, Pl. II.); Apollo and the
executioner complete the group. In the Lateran museum at
Rome there is a statue representing Marsyas in the act of
picking up the flute, a copy of a masterpiece by Myron (Hyginus,
<i>Fab.</i> 167, 191; Apollodorus i. 4, 2; Ovid, <i>Metam.</i> vi. 382-400,

<p><span class="bold">MARTELLO TOWER,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> a kind of tower formerly used in
English coast defence. The name is a corruption of Mortella.
The Martello tower was introduced in consequence of an incident
of the French revolutionary wars. In September 1793 a
British squadron of three ships of the line and two frigates was
ordered to support the Corsican insurgents. It was determined
in the first place to take a tower on Cape Mortella which commanded
the only secure anchorage in the Gulf of San Fiorenzo.
This tower, according to James, was named &ldquo;after its inventor&rdquo;;
but the real derivation appears to be the name of a wild myrtle
which grew thickly around. The tower, which mounted one
24-pounder and two 18-pounders on its top, was bombarded
for a short time by the frigates, was then deserted by its little
garrison, and occupied by a landing party. The tower was
afterwards retaken by the French from the Corsicans. So far
it had done nothing to justify its subsequent reputation. In
1794, however, a fresh attempt was made to support the insurgents.
On the 7th of February 1400 troops were landed, and
the tower was attacked by land and sea on the 8th. The
&ldquo;Fortitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;Juno&rdquo; kept up a cannonade for 2½ hours
and then hauled off, the former being on fire and having sixty-two
men killed and wounded. The fire from the batteries on
shore produced no impression until a hot shot set fire to the
&ldquo;bass junk with which, to the depth of 5 ft., the immensely
thick parapet was lined.&rdquo; The garrison of thirty-three men
then surrendered. The armament was found to consist only
of two 18-pounders and one 6-pounder. The strong resistance
offered by these three guns seems to have led to the conclusion
that towers of this description were specially formidable, and
Martello towers were built in large numbers, and at heavy
expense, along the shores of England, especially on the southern
and eastern coasts, which in certain parts are lined with these
towers at short intervals. They are structures of solid masonry,
containing vaulted rooms for the garrison, and providing a
platform at the top for two or three guns, which fire over a
low masonry parapet. Access is provided by a ladder, communicating
with a door about 20 ft. above the ground. In some cases
a deep ditch is provided around the base. The chief defect of
the tower was its weakness against vertical fire; its masonry
was further liable to be cut through by breaching batteries.
The French <i>tours modèles</i> were somewhat similar to the Martello
towers; their chief use was to serve as keeps to unrevetted
works. While the Martello tower owes its reputation and its
widespread adoption in Great Britain to a single incident of
modern warfare, the round masonry structure entered by a door
raised high above the base is to be found in many lands, and is
one of the earliest types of masonry fortification.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTEN, HENRY<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1602-1680), English regicide, was the
elder son of Sir Henry Marten, and was educated at University
College, Oxford. As a public man he first became prominent
in 1639 when he refused to contribute to a general loan, and
in 1640 he entered parliament as one of the members for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page785" id="page785"></a>785</span>
Berkshire. In the House of Commons he joined the popular party,
spoke in favour of the proposed bill of attainder against Strafford,
and in 1642 was a member of the committee of safety. Some
of his language about the king was so frank that Charles
demanded his arrest and his trial for high treason. When the
Great Rebellion broke out Marten did not take the field, although
he was appointed governor of Reading, but in parliament he
was very active. On one occasion his zeal in the parliamentary
cause led him to open a letter from the earl of Northumberland
to his countess, an impertinence for which, says Clarendon, he
was &ldquo;cudgelled&rdquo; by the earl; and in 1643, on account of some
remark about extirpating the royal family, he was expelled
from parliament and was imprisoned for a few days. In the
following year, however, he was made governor of Aylesbury,
and about this time took some small part in the war. Allowed
to return to parliament in January 1646, Marten again advocated
extreme views. He spoke of his desire to prepare the king for
heaven; he attacked the Presbyterians, and, supporting the
army against the parliament, he signed the agreement of August
1647. He was closely associated with John Lilburne and the
Levellers, and was one of those who suspected the sincerity of
Cromwell, whose murder he is said personally to have contemplated.
However, he acted with Cromwell in bringing Charles I.
to trial; he was one of the most prominent of the king&rsquo;s judges
and signed the death warrant. He was then energetic in
establishing the republic and in destroying the remaining vestiges
of the monarchical system. He was chosen a member of the
council of state in 1649, and as compensation for his losses and
reward for his services during the war, lands valued at £1000
a year were settled upon him. In parliament he spoke often
and with effect, but he took no part in public life during the
Protectorate, passing part of this time in prison, where he was
placed on account of his debts. Having sat among the restored
members of the Long Parliament in 1659, Marten surrendered
himself to the authorities as a regicide in June 1660, and with
some others he was excepted from the act of indemnity, but
with a saving clause. He behaved courageously at his trial,
which took place in October 1660, but he was found guilty of
taking part in the king&rsquo;s death. Through the action, or rather
the inaction of the House of Lords, he was spared the death
penalty, but he remained a captive, and was in prison at
Chepstow Castle when he died on the 9th of September 1680.
Although a leading Puritan, Marten was a man of loose morals.
He wrote and published several pamphlets, and in 1662 there
appeared <i>Henry Marten&rsquo;s Familiar Letters to his Lady of Delight</i>,
which contained letters to his mistress, Mary Ward.</p>

<p>Marten&rsquo;s father, Sir Henry Marten (<i>c.</i> 1562-1641), was born
in London and was educated at Winchester school and at New
College, Oxford, becoming a fellow of the college in 1582. Having
become a barrister, he secured a large practice and soon came to
the front in public life. He was sent abroad on some royal
business, was made chancellor of the diocese of London, was
knighted, and in 1617 became a judge of the admiralty court.
Later he was appointed a member of the court of high commission
and dean of the arches. He became a member of parliament
in 1625, and in 1628 represented the university of Oxford, taking
part in the debates on the petition of right.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTEN,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span><a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> a name originally belonging to the pine-marten
(<i>Mustela martes</i>), but now applied to all members of the same
genus of carnivorous mammals (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>). Martens are
limited to the northern hemisphere, ranging throughout the
greater part of the northern temperate regions of both Old and
New Worlds, and southwards in America to 35° N. lat., while in
Asia one species is met with in Java.</p>

<p>The species appear to be similar in their habits. They live
in woods and rocky places, and spend most of their time in trees,
although descending to the ground in quest of prey. They
climb with great facility, and are agile and graceful in their
movements. Some are said occasionally to resort to berries
and other fruit for food, but as a rule they are carnivorous,
feeding chiefly on birds and their eggs, small mammals, as
squirrels, hares, rabbits and moles, but chiefly mice of various
kinds, and occasionally snakes, lizards and frogs. In proportion
to their size they are among the most bloodthirsty of animals,
though less so than the weasels. The female makes her nest
of moss, dried leaves and grass in the hollow of a tree, but
sometimes in a hole among rocks or ruined buildings, and produces
several young at a birth, usually from four to six. Though
wild and untameable to a great degree if captured when fully
grown, if taken young they are docile, and have frequently
been made pets, not having the strong unpleasant odour of the
smaller <i>Mustelidae</i>. The pine-marten appears to have been
partially domesticated by the Greeks and Romans, and used to
keep houses clear from rats and mice. In the same way, according
to Brian Hodgson, the yellow-bellied weasel (<i>Putorius kathia</i>)
&ldquo;is exceedingly prized by the Nepalese for its service in ridding
houses of rats. It is easily tamed; and such is the dread of it
common to all murine animals that not one will approach a
house where it is domiciled.&rdquo; It is, however, to the great value
attached to the pelts of these animals that their importance
to man is chiefly due. Though all yield fur of serviceable
quality, the commercial value varies immensely, not only according
to the species from which it is obtained, but according to
individual variation, depending upon age, sex, season, and other
circumstances. The skins from northern regions are more
full and of a finer colour and gloss than those from more temperate
climates, as are those of animals killed in winter compared
to the same individuals in summer. Fashion has, moreover,
set fictitious values upon slight shades of colour. Enormous
numbers of animals are caught, chiefly in traps, to supply the
demand of the fur trade, Siberia and North America being the
principal localities from which they are obtained.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>With the exception of the pekan (<i>M. pennanti</i>), the martens are
much alike in size, general colouring and cranial and dental characters.
The following description by Dr Elliott Coues of the American
marten (<i>M. americana</i>) will apply almost equally well to most of the
others. &ldquo;It is almost impossible to describe the colour of the
marten, except in general terms, without going into the details of
the endless diversities occasioned by age, sex, season, or other incidents.
The animal is &lsquo;brown,&rsquo; of a shade from orange or tawny
to quite blackish; the tail and feet are ordinarily the darkest, the
head lightest, often quite whitish; the ears usually have a whitish
rim, while on the throat there is usually a large tawny-yellowish or
orange-brown patch, from the chin to the fore legs; sometimes entire,
sometimes broken into a number of smaller, irregular blotches,
sometimes wanting, sometimes prolonged on the whole under surface,
when the animal is bicolor like a stoat in summer. The general
&lsquo;brown&rsquo; has a greyish cast, as far as the under fur is concerned,
and is overlaid with rich lustrous blackish-brown in places where
the long bristly hairs prevail. The claws are whitish; the naked
nose pad and whiskers are black. The tail occasionally shows
interspersed white hairs, or a white tip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following are the best-known species:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mustela foina</i>: the beech-marten, stone-marten or white-breasted
marten.&mdash;Distinguished from the following by the greater breadth
of the skull, and some minute but constant dental characters, by
the dull greyish-brown colour of the fur of the upper parts and the
pure white of the throat and breast. It inhabits the greater part
of the continent of Europe, but is more southern than the next in
its distribution, not being found in Sweden or Norway.</p>

<p><i>M. martes</i>, the pine-marten (see figure).&mdash;Fur rich dark brown;
under fur reddish-grey, with clear yellow tips; breast spot usually
yellow, varying from bright orange to pale cream-colour or yellowish-white.
Length of head and body 16 to 18 in., of tail (including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page786" id="page786"></a>786</span>
the hair) 9 to 12 in. This species is extensively distributed
throughout northern Europe and Asia, and was formerly common
in most parts of Great Britain and Ireland. It is still found in the
northern counties of England and North Wales, but in decreasing
numbers. In Scotland it is rare, but in Ireland may be found in
almost every county occasionally. Though commonly called
&ldquo;pine-marten,&rdquo; it does not appear to have any special preference
for coniferous trees.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">The Pine-Marten (<i>Mustela martes</i>).</td></tr></table>

<p>Next comes <i>M. zibellina</i>, the sable (German, <i>Zobel</i> and <i>Zebel</i>;
Swedish, <i>sabel</i>; Russian, <i>sobel</i>, a word probably of Turanian origin),
which closely resembles the last, if indeed it differs except in the
quality of the fur&mdash;the most highly valued of that of all the group.
The sable is found chiefly in eastern Siberia.</p>

<p>Very distinct is the brilliantly coloured orange-and-black Indian
marten (<i>M. flavigula</i>), found from the Himalaya and Ceylon to
Java.</p>

<p>The North American <i>M. americana</i> is closely allied to the pine-marten
and Asiatic sable. The importance of the fur of this animal
as an article of commerce may be judged of from the fact that 15,000
skins were sold in one year by the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company as long ago
as 1743. It is ordinarily caught in wooden traps of simple construction,
being little enclosures of stakes or brush in which the bait
is placed upon a trigger, with a short upright stick supporting a log
of wood, which falls upon its victim on the slightest disturbance.
A line of such traps, several to a mile, often extends many miles.
The bait is any kind of meat, a mouse, squirrel, piece of fish or bird&rsquo;s
head. It is principally trapped during the colder months, from
October to April, when the fur is in good condition, as it is nearly
valueless during the shedding in summer. It maintains its numbers
partly in consequence of its shyness, which keeps it away from the
abodes of men, and partly because it is so prolific, bringing forth
six to eight young at a litter. Its home is sometimes a den under
ground or beneath rocks, but oftener the hollow of a tree, and it is
said to take possession of a squirrel&rsquo;s nest, driving off or devouring
the rightful proprietor.</p>

<p>The pekan or Pennant&rsquo;s marten, also called fisher marten, though
there appears to be nothing in its habits to justify the appellation,
is the largest of the group, the head and body measuring from 24
to 30 in., and the tail 14 to 18 in. It is also more robust in
form than the others, its general aspect being more that of a fox
than a weasel; in fact its usual name among the American hunters
is &ldquo;black fox.&rdquo; Its general colour is blackish, lighter by mixture
of brown or grey on the head and upper fore part of the body, with
no light patch on the throat, and unlike other martens generally
darker below than above. It was generally distributed in wooded
districts throughout the greater part of North America, as far north
as Great Slave Lake, lat. 63° N., and Alaska, and extending south
to the parallel of 35°; but at the present time is almost exterminated
in the settled parts of the United States east of the Mississippi.</p>

of public law in the Imperial School of Law and the
Imperial Alexander Lyceum. In 1874 when Prince Gorchakov,
then imperial chancellor, needed assistance for certain kinds of
special work, Martens was chosen to afford it. His book on
<i>The Right of Private Property in War</i> had appeared in 1869,
and had been followed in 1873 by that upon <i>The Office of Consul
and Consular Jurisdiction in the East</i>, which had been translated
into German and republished at Berlin. These were the first
of a long series of studies which won for their author a world-wide
reputation, and raised the character of the Russian school of
international jurisprudence in all civilized countries. First
amongst them must be placed the great <i>Recueil des traités et
conventions conclus par la Russie avec les puissances étrangères</i>
(13 vols., 1874-1902). This collection, published in Russian and
French in parallel columns, contains not only the texts of the
treaties but valuable introductions dealing with the diplomatic
conditions of which the treaties were the outcome. These
introductions are based largely on unpublished documents from
the Russian archives. Of Martens&rsquo; original works his <i>International
Law of Civilized Nations</i> is perhaps the best known;
it was written in Russian, a German edition appearing in 1884-1885,
and a French edition in 1887-1888. It displays much
judgment and acumen, though some of the doctrines which it
defends by no means command universal assent. More openly
&ldquo;tendencious&rdquo; in character are such treatises as <i>Russia and
England in Central Asia</i> (1879); <i>Russia&rsquo;s Conflict with China</i>
(1881), <i>The Egyptian Question</i> (1882), and <i>The African Conference
of Berlin and the Colonial Policy of Modern States</i> (1887).
In the delicate questions raised in some of these works Martens
stated his case with learning and ability, even when it was
obvious that he was arguing as a special pleader. Martens was
repeatedly chosen to act in international arbitrations. Among
the controversies which he helped to adjust were that between
Mexico and the United States&mdash;the first case determined by
the permanent tribunal of The Hague&mdash;and the difference
between Great Britain and France in regard to Newfoundland
in 1891. He played an important part in the negotiations
between his own country and Japan, which led to the peace of
Portsmouth (Aug. 1905) and prepared the way for the
Russo-Japanese convention. He was employed in laying the
foundations for The Hague Conferences. He was one of the
Russian plenipotentiaries at the first conference and president
of the fourth committee&mdash;that on maritime law&mdash;at the second
conference. His visits to the chief capitals of Europe in the
early part of 1907 were an important preliminary in the preparation
of the programme. He was judge of the Russian
supreme prize court established to determine cases arising during
the war with Japan. He received honorary degrees from the
universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Yale; he was also awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902. In April 1907 he addressed a
remarkable letter to <i>The Times</i> on the position of the second
Duma, in which he argued that the best remedy for the ills of
Russia would be the dissolution of that assembly and the election
of another on a narrower franchise. He died suddenly on the
20th of June 1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTENS, GEORG FRIEDRICH VON<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1756-1821), German
jurist and diplomatist, was born at Hamburg on the 22nd of
February 1756. Educated at the universities of Göttingen,
Regensburg and Vienna, he became professor of jurisprudence at
Göttingen in 1783 and was ennobled in 1789. He was made
a counsellor of state by the elector of Hanover in 1808, and in
1810 was president of the financial section of the council of
state of the kingdom of Westphalia. In 1814 he was appointed
privy cabinet-councillor (<i>Geheimer Kabinetsrat</i>) by the king of
Hanover, and in 1816 went as representative of the king to the
diet of the new German Confederation at Frankfort, where he
died on the 21st of February 1821.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of his works the most important is the great collection of treaties
<i>Recueil des traités, &amp;c.</i> from 1761 onwards. Of this the first seven
volumes were published at Göttingen (1791-1801), followed by four
supplementary volumes partly edited by his nephew Karl von
Martens (see below). These were followed by <i>Nouveau recueil</i>, of
treaties subsequent to 1808, in 16 vols. (Göttingen, 1817-1842), of
which G. F. von Martens edited the first four, the fifth being the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page787" id="page787"></a>787</span>
work of K. von Martens, the others (6-9) by F. Saalfeld and (10-16)
F. Murhard. A <i>Nouveau supplément</i>, in 3 vols., filling gaps in
the previous collection, was also published by Murhard (Göttingen,
1839-1842). This was followed by <i>Nouveau recueil ... continuation
du grand recueil de Martens</i>, in 20 vols. (Göttingen, 1843-1875),
edited in turn by F. Murhard, C. Murhard, J. Pinhas, C. Samwer
and J. Hopf, with a general index of treaties from 1494 to 1874 (1876).
This was followed by <i>Nouveau recueil, 2me série</i> (Göttingen, 1876-1896;
vols. xxii.-xxxv., Leipzig, 1897-1908). From vol. xi. on
this series was edited by Felix Stork, professor of public law at
Greifswald. In 1909 appeared vol. i. of a further <i>Continuation</i>
(<i>troisième série</i>) under the editorship of Professor Heinrich Triepel
of Kiel University.</p>

<p>Of Martens&rsquo; other works the most important are the <i>Précis du
droit des gens modernes de l&rsquo;Europe</i> (1789; 3rd ed., Göttingen, 1821;
new ed., G. S. Pinheiro-Ferreira, 2 vols., 1858, 1864); <i>Erzählungen
merkwürdiger Fälle des neueren europäischen Völkerrechts</i>, 2 vols.
(Göttingen, 1800-1802); <i>Cours diplomatique ou tableau des relations
des puissances de l&rsquo;Europe</i>, 3 vols. (Berlin, 1801); <i>Grundriss einer
diplomatischen Gesch. der europ. Staatshändel u. Friedensschlüsse
seit dem Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts</i> (ibid. 1807).</p>

<p>His nephew <span class="sc">Karl von Martens</span> (1790-1863), who at his death
was minister resident of the grand-duke of Weimar at Dresden,
published a <i>Manuel diplomatique</i> (Leipzig, 1823), re-issued as <i>Guide
diplomatique</i> in two vols. in 1832 (5th ed. by Geffcken, 1866), a
valuable textbook of the rules and customs of the diplomatic
service; <i>Causes célèbres du droit des gens</i> (2 vols., ibid., 1827) and
<i>Nouvelles causes célèbres</i> (2 vols., ibid., 1843), both republished, in
5 vols. (1858-1861); <i>Recueil manuel et pratique de traités</i> (7 vols., ibid.,

<p><span class="bold">MARTENSEN, HANS LASSEN<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (1808-1884), Danish divine,
was born at Flensburg on the 19th of August 1808. He studied
in Copenhagen, and was ordained in the Danish Church. At
Copenhagen he was lektor in theology in 1838, professor extra-ordinarius
in 1840, court preacher also in 1845, and professor
ordinarius in 1850. In 1854 he was made bishop of Seeland.
In his studies he had come under the influence of Schleiermacher,
Hegel and Franz Baader; but he was a man of independent
mind, and developed a peculiar speculative theology which
showed a disposition towards mysticism and theosophy. His
contributions to theological literature included treatises on
Christian ethics and dogmatics, on moral philosophy, on baptism,
and a sketch of the life of Jakob Boehme, who exercised so
marked an influence on the mind of the great English theologian
of the 18th century, William Law. Martensen was a distinguished
preacher, and his works were translated into various
languages. The &ldquo;official&rdquo; eulogy he pronounced upon Bishop
Jakob P. Mynster (1775-1854) in 1854, brought down upon
his head the invectives of the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
He died at Copenhagen on the 3rd of February 1884.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Amongst his works are: <i>Grundriss des Systems der Moralphilosophie</i>

<p><span class="bold">MARTHA&rsquo;S VINEYARD,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> an island including the greater
part of Dukes county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., lying about
3 m. off the southern coast of that state. Its extreme length
(east to west) is about 20 m., and its extreme width (north
to south) about 9½ m. Along its north-west and a portion of its
north-east shore lies Vineyard Sound. Its principal bays are
Vineyard Haven Harbor, a deep indentation at the northernmost
angle of the island; and, on the eastern coast, Edgartown
Harbor and Katama Bay, both formed by the juxtaposition
of Chappaquiddick Island. The surface is mainly flat, excepting
a strip about 2 m. broad along the north-western coast, and
the two western townships (Chilmark and Gay Head), which
are hilly, with several eminences of 200 to 300 ft.&mdash;the highest,
Prospect Peak, in Chilmark township, 308 ft. Gay Head
Light, a beacon near the western extremity, stands among
picturesque cliffs, 145 ft. above the sea. Along the southern
coast are many ponds, all shut off from the ocean by a narrow
strip of land, excepting Tisbury Great Pond, which has a small
outlet to the sea. Others are Sengekontacket Pond on the
eastern coast; Lagoon Pond, which is practically an arm of
Vineyard Haven Harbor; and, about a mile east of the Harbor,
Chappaquonsett Pond. Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard is divided into
the following townships (from east to west): Edgartown (in
the south-eastern part of the island), pop. (1910), 1191; area,
29.7 sq. m.; Oak Bluffs (north-eastern portion), pop. (1910),
1084; area, 7.9 sq. m.; Tisbury, pop. (1910), 1196; area, 7.1 sq.
m.; West Tisbury, pop. (1910), 437; area, 30.5 sq. m.; Chilmark,
pop. (1910), 282; area, 19.4 sq. m.; and Gay Head, pop. (1910),
162; area 5.2 sq. m. The population of the county, including
the Elizabeth Ids. (Gosnold town, pop. 152), N. W. of Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard; Chappaquiddick Island (Edgartown township),
and No Man&rsquo;s Land (a small island south-west of Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard), was 4561 in 1900 (of whom 645 were foreign-born,
including 79 Portuguese and 72 English-Canadians, and 154
Indians), and in 1910, 4504. The principal villages are Oak
Bluffs on the north-east coast, facing Vineyard Sound; Vineyard
Haven, in Tisbury township, beautifully situated on the west
shore of Vineyard Haven Harbor, and Edgartown on Edgartown
Harbor&mdash;all summer resorts. No Man&rsquo;s Land, included
politically in Chilmark township, lies about 6½ m. south of
Gay Head. It is about 1½ m. long (east and west) and about
1 m. wide, is composed of treeless swamps, and is used mainly
for sheep-grazing; the neighbouring waters are excellent fishing
ground. Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard is served by steamship lines from
Wood&rsquo;s Hole and New Bedford to Vineyard Haven, Oak Bluffs,
and Edgartown. The Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard railway (from Oak
Bluffs to the south-east extremity of the island, by way of
Edgartown), opened in 1874, was not a financial success, and
had been practically abandoned in 1909, but an electric line
from Oak Bluffs to Vineyard Haven provides transit facilities
for that part of the island.</p>

<p>For more than a century whale fishing was practically the
sole industry of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. It was carried on at
first from the shore in small boats; but by the first decade
of the 18th century vessels especially built for the purpose
were being used, and by 1760 shore fishing had been practically
abandoned. The industry, seriously crippled by invasions
of British troops during the War of American Independence&mdash;especially
by a force which landed at Holmes&rsquo;s Hole (Vineyard
Haven) in September 1778&mdash;and again during the War of
1812, revived and was at its height in 1840-1850, only to receive
another setback during the Civil War. In the last part of
the 19th century its decline was rapid, not only because of the
increasing scarcity of whales, but because of the introduction
of the mineral oils, and by the end of the century whaling had
ceased to be of any economic importance. Herring fishing,
on both the north and the south shore, occupies a small percentage
of the inhabitants, and there is also some deep-sea fishing.
Sheep-raising, especially for wool, is an industry of considerable
importance, and Dukes county is one of the three most important
counties of the state in this industry.</p>

<p>Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard was discovered in 1602 by Captain Bartholomew
Gosnold, who landed (May 21) on the island now
called No Man&rsquo;s Land, and named it Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard,<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
which name was subsequently applied to the larger island.
Captain Gosnold rounded Gay Head, which he named Dover
Cliff, and established on what is now Cuttyhunk Island, which
he called Elizabeth Island, the first (though, as it proved,
a temporary) English settlement in New England. The entire
line of sixteen islands, of which Cuttyhunk is the westernmost
of the larger ones, have since been called the Elizabeth Islands;
they form the dividing line between Buzzards Bay and Vineyard
Sound, and in 1864 were incorporated as Gosnold township
(pop. in 1905, 161) of Dukes county.</p>

<p>The territory within the jurisdiction of the Council for New
England was parcelled in 1635 among the patentees in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page788" id="page788"></a>788</span>
terms&mdash;owing to insufficient knowledge of the geography of
the coast&mdash;that both William Alexander, earl of Stirling, and
Sir Ferdinando Gorges, proprietor of Maine, claimed Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard. In 1641 Stirling&rsquo;s agent, Forrett, sold to Thomas
Mayhew (1592-1682),<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> of Watertown, Massachusetts, for $200,
the island of Nantucket, with several smaller neighbouring
islands, and also Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. It seems probable that
Forrett acted without authority, and his successor, Forrester,
was arrested by the Dutch in New Amsterdam and sent to
Holland before he could confirm the transfer. In 1644 the
Commissioners of the United Colonies, apparently at the request
of the inhabitants of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, annexed the island to
Massachusetts, but ten years later the islanders declared their
independence of that colony, and apparently for the next
decade managed their own affairs. Meanwhile Mayhew had
recognized the jurisdiction of Maine;<a name="fa3g" id="fa3g" href="#ft3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and though the officials
of that province showed no disposition to press their claim,
it seems that this technical suzerainty continued until 1664,
when the Duke of York received from his brother, Charles II.,
the charter for governing New York, New Jersey, and other
territory, including Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. In 1671 Governor
Francis Lovelace, of New York, appointed Mayhew governor
for life of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard; in 1683, the island, with Nantucket,
the Elizabeth Islands, No Man&rsquo;s Land, and Chappaquiddick
Island were erected into Dukes county, and in 1695 the county
was re-incorporated by Massachusetts with Nantucket excluded.
Under the new charter of Massachusetts Bay (1691), after
some dispute between Massachusetts and New York, Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard became a part of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that the first settlement of Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard was made in 1632, at or near the present site of Edgartown
village, by several English families forming part of a
company bound for Virginia, their ship having put in at this
harbour on account of heavy weather. It is certain, however,
that in 1642, the year after Thomas Mayhew bought the island,
his son, also named Thomas Mayhew (<i>c.</i> 1616-1657), and several
other persons established a plantation on the site of what is
now Edgartown village. This settlement was at first called
&ldquo;Great Harbor,&rdquo; but soon after Mayhew was appointed
governor of the island it was named Edgartown, probably
in honour of the only surviving son of the Duke of York. The
younger Mayhew, soon after removing to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard,
devoted himself to missionary work among the Indians, his
work beginning at about the same time as that of John Eliot;
he was lost at sea in 1657 while on his way to secure financial
assistance in England, and his work was continued successfully
by his father.<a name="fa4g" id="fa4g" href="#ft4g"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The township of Edgartown was incorporated
in 1671, and is the county-seat of Dukes county. In 1783
several Edgartown families joined the association made up of
Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, Nantucket, Providence and Newport
whalers, who founded Hudson, on the Hudson river, in Columbia
county, New York. Oak Bluffs had its origin as a settlement
in the camp meetings, which were begun here in 1835, and by
1860 had grown to large proportions. As the village expanded
it took the name of Cottage City. In 1880 the township was
incorporated under that name, which it retained until January
1907, when the name (and that of the village also) was changed
to Oak Bluffs. Tisbury township was bought from the Indians
in 1669 and was incorporated in 1671. Its principal village,
Vineyard Haven, was called &ldquo;Holmes&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo; (in honour
of one of the early settlers) until 1871, when the present name
was adopted. West Tisbury township was set off from Tisbury,
and incorporated in 1892. Chilmark township was incorporated
in 1694. Gay Head township was set off from Chilmark,
and incorporated in 1870.</p>

Vineyard&rdquo; were used, and the latter appears in a book as early as
1638 and in another as late as 1699, and on a map as late as 1670.
It seems probable that the original form was <i>Martin</i> the name of
one of Gosnold&rsquo;s crew; according to some authorities the name
Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard was adopted by Mayhew in honour of his wife
or daughter.</p>

<p><a name="ft2g" id="ft2g" href="#fa2g"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Mayhew was born at Tisbury, Wiltshire, was a merchant in
Southampton, emigrated to Massachusetts about 1633, settled at
Watertown, Mass., in 1635; was a member of the Massachusetts
General Court in 1636-1644, and after 1644 or 1645 lived on
Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard.</p>

<p><a name="ft3g" id="ft3g" href="#fa3g"><span class="fn">3</span></a> It appears from a letter from Mayhew to Governor Andros in
1675 that about 1641 Mayhew obtained a conveyance to Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard from Richard Vines, agent of Gorges. See F. B. Hough,
<i>Papers Relating to the Island of Nantucket, with Documents Relating
to the Original Settlement of that Island, Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, &amp;c.</i>
(Albany, N.Y., 1856).</p>

<p><a name="ft4g" id="ft4g" href="#fa4g"><span class="fn">4</span></a> In 1901, a boulder memorial was erected to the younger Mayhew
on the West Tisbury road, between the village of that name and
Edgartown, marking the spot where the missionary bade farewell
to several hundred Indians. The Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard Indians were
subject to the Wampanoag tribe, on the mainland, were expert
watermen, and were very numerous when the whites first came.
Nearly all of them were converted to Christianity by the Mayhews,
and they were friendly to the settlers during King Philip&rsquo;s war.
By 1698 their numbers had been reduced to about 1000, and by
1764 to about 300. Soon after this they began to intermarry with
negroes, and now only faint traces of them remain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTÍ, JUAN JOSÉ<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1570?-1604), Spanish novelist, was
born at Orihuela (Valencia) about 1570. He graduated as
bachelor of canon law at Valencia in 1591, and in 1598 took
his degree as doctor of canon law; in the latter year he was
appointed co-examiner in canon law at Valencia University,
and held the post for six years. He died at Valencia, and
was buried in the cathedral of that city on the 22nd of December
1604. Martí joined the Valencian <i>Academia de los nocturnos</i>,
under the name of &ldquo;Atrevimiento,&rdquo; but is best known by
another pseudonym, Mateo Luján de Sayavedra, under which
he issued an apocryphal continuation (1602) of Alemán&rsquo;s <i>Guzmán
de Alfarache</i> (1599). Marti obtained access to Alemán&rsquo;s unfinished
manuscript, and stole some of his ideas; this dishonesty
lends point to the sarcastic congratulations which Alemán,
in the genuine sequel (1604) pays to his rival&rsquo;s sallies: &ldquo;I
greatly envy them, and should be proud that they were mine.&rdquo;
Martí&rsquo;s book is clever, but the circumstances in which it was
produced account for its cold reception and afford presumption
that the best scenes are not original.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It has been suggested that Martí is identical with Avellaneda, the
writer of a spurious continuation (1614) to <i>Don Quixote</i>; but he
died before the first part of <i>Don Quixote</i> was published (1605).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIAL<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Marcus Valerius Martialis</span>), Latin epigrammatist,
was born, in one of the years <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 38-41, for in
book x., of which the poems were composed in the years 95-98,
he is found celebrating his fifty-seventh birthday (x. 24). Our
knowledge of his career is derived almost entirely from himself.
Reference to public events enables us approximately to fix the
date of the publication of the different books of epigrams, and
from these dates to determine those of various important events
in his life. The place of his birth was Bilbilis, officially Augusta
Bilbilis, in Spain. His name seems to imply that he was born
a Roman citizen, but he speaks of himself as &ldquo;sprung from the
Celts and Iberians, and a countryman of the Tagus;&rdquo; and,
in contrasting his own masculine appearance with that of an
effeminate Greek, he draws especial attention to &ldquo;his stiff
Spanish hair&rdquo; (x. 65, 7). His parents, Fronto and Flaccilla,
appear to have died in his youth (v. 34). His home was evidently
one of rude comfort and plenty, sufficiently in the country
to afford him the amusements of hunting and fishing, which
he often recalls with keen pleasure, and sufficiently near the
town to afford him the companionship of many comrades,
the few survivors of whom he looks forward to meeting again
after his four-and-thirty years&rsquo; absence (x. 104). The memories
of this old home, and of other spots, the rough names and
local associations which he delights to introduce into his
verse, attest the enjoyment which he had in his early life, and
were among the influences which kept his spirit alive in the
routine of social life in Rome. But his Spanish home could
impart, not only the vigorous vitality which was one condition
of his success as a wit and poet, but the education which made
him so accomplished a writer. The literary distinction obtained
by the Senecas, by Lucan, by Quintilian, who belonged to a
somewhat older generation, and by his friends and contemporaries,
Licinianus of Bilbilis, Decianus of Emerita, and Canius
of Gades, proves how eagerly the novel impulse of letters was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page789" id="page789"></a>789</span>
received in Spain in the first century of the empire. The
success of his countrymen may have been the motive which
induced Martial to remove to Rome when he had completed
his education. This he did in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 64, one year before the
fall of Seneca and Lucan, who were probably his earliest patrons.</p>

<p>Of the details of his life for the first twenty years or so after
he came to Rome we do not know much. He published some
juvenile poems of which he thought very little in his maturer
years, and he laughs at a foolish bookseller who would not
allow them to die a natural death (i. 113). Martial had neither
youthful passion nor youthful enthusiasm to make him precociously
a poet. His faculty ripened with experience and
with the knowledge of that social life which was both his theme
and his inspiration; and many of his best epigrams are among
those written in his last years. From many answers which he
makes to the remonstrances of friends&mdash;among others to those
of Quintilian&mdash;it may be inferred that he was urged to practise
at the bar, but that he preferred his own lazy Bohemian kind
of life. He made many influential friends and patrons, and
secured the favour both of Titus and Domitian. From them
he obtained various privileges, among others the <i>semestris
tribunatus</i>, which conferred on him equestrian rank. He failed,
however, in his application to the latter for more substantial
advantages, although he commemorates the glory of having
been invited to dinner by him, and also the fact that he procured
the privilege of citizenship for many persons in whose behalf
he appealed to him. The earliest of his extant works, that
known by the name of <i>Liber spectaculorum</i>, was first published
at the opening of the Colosseum in the reign of Titus, and relates
to the theatrical performances given by him; but the book
as it now stands was given to the world in or about the first
year of Domitian, <i>i.e.</i> about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 81. The favour of the emperor
procured him the countenance of some of the worst creatures
at the imperial court&mdash;among them of the notorious Crispinus,
and probably of Paris, the supposed author of Juvenal&rsquo;s exile,
for whose monument Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic
epitaph. The two books, numbered by editors xiii. and xiv.,
and known by the names of <i>Xenia</i> and <i>Apophoreta</i>&mdash;inscriptions
in two lines each for presents,&mdash;were published at the
Saturnalia of 84. In 86 he gave to the world the first two
of the twelve books on which his reputation rests. From
that time till his return to Spain in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 98 he published a volume
almost every year. The first nine books and the first edition
of book x. appeared in the reign of Domitian; and book xi.
at the end of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 96, shortly after the accession of Nerva.
A revised edition of book x., that which we now possess, appeared
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 98, about the time of the entrance of Trajan into Rome.
The last book was written after three years&rsquo; absence in Spain,
shortly before his death, which happened about the year <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 102
or 103.</p>

<p>These twelve books bring Martial&rsquo;s ordinary mode of life
between the age of five-and-forty and sixty very fully before
us. His regular home for five-and-thirty years was Rome.
He lived at first up three pairs of stairs, and his &ldquo;garret&rdquo;
overlooked the laurels in front of the portico of Agrippa.
He had a small villa and unproductive farm near Nomentum, in
the Sabine territory, to which he occasionally retired from the
bores and noises of the city (ii. 38, xii. 57). In his later years
he had also a small house on the Quirinal, near the temple
of Quirinus. At the time when his third book was brought
out he had retired for a short time to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness,
as he tells us, of his unremunerative attendance on the levées
of the great. For a time he seems to have felt the charm of
the new scenes which he visited, and in a later book (iv. 25)
he contemplates the prospect of retiring to the neighbourhood
of Aquileia and the Timavus. But the spell exercised over him
by Rome and Roman society was too great; even the epigrams
sent from Forum Corneli and the Aemilian Way ring much more
of the Roman forum, and of the streets, baths, porticos and
clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated.
So too his motive for his final departure from Rome in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 98
was a weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social
position, and apparently the difficulties of meeting the ordinary
expenses of living in the metropolis (x. 96); and he looks forward
to a return to the scenes familiar to his youth. The well-known
epigram addressed to Juvenal (xii. 18) shows that for a time
his ideal was realized; but the more trustworthy evidence
of the prose epistle prefixed to book xii. proves that his contentment
was of short duration, and that he could not live
happily away from the literary and social pleasures of Rome.
The one consolation of his exile was the society of a lady, Marcella,
of whom he writes rather as if she were his patroness&mdash;and
it seems to have been a necessity of his being to have always
a patron or patroness&mdash;than his wife or mistress.</p>

<p>During his life at Rome, although he never rose to a position
of real independence, and had always a hard struggle with
poverty, he seems to have known everybody, especially every
one of any eminence at the bar or in literature. In addition
to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his friends or
more intimate acquaintances Silius Italicus, Juvenal, the younger
Pliny; and there were many others of high position whose
society and patronage he enjoyed. The silence which he and
Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having
common friends and treating often of the same subjects, maintain
in regard to one another may be explained by mutual
dislike or want of sympathy. Martial in many places shows
an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which
Statius&rsquo;s reputation chiefly rests; and it seems quite natural
that the respectable author of the <i>Thebaid</i> and the <i>Silvae</i> should
feel little admiration for either the life or the works of the
Bohemian epigrammatist.</p>

<p>Martial&rsquo;s faults are of the most glaring kind, and are exhibited
without the least concealment. Living under perhaps the
worst of the many bad emperors who ruled the world in the
1st century, he addresses him and his favourites with the most
servile flattery in his lifetime, censures him immediately after
his death (xii. 6), and offers incense at the shrine of his successor.
He is not ashamed to be dependent on his wealthy friends and
patrons for gifts of money, for his dinner, and even for his dress.
We cannot feel sure that even what seem his sincerest tributes
of regard may not be prompted by the hope of payment. Further,
there are in every book epigrams which cannot be read with
any other feelings than those of extreme distaste.</p>

<p>These faults are so unmistakable and undeniable that many
have formed their whole estimate of Martial from them, and
have declined to make any further acquaintance with him.
Even those who greatly admire his genius, and find the freshest
interest in his representation of Roman life and his sketches
of manners and character, do not attempt to palliate his faults,
though they may partially account for them by reference to
the morals of his age and the circumstances of his life. The
age was one when literature had either to be silent or to be
servile. Martial was essentially a man of letters: he was bound
either to gain favour by his writings or to starve. Even Statius,
whose writings are in other respects irreproachable, is nearly
as fulsome in his adulation. The relation of client to patron
had been recognized as an honourable one by the best Roman
traditions. No blame had attached to Virgil or Horace on
account of the favours which they received from Augustus and
Maecenas, or of the return which they made for these favours
in their verse. That old honourable relationship had, however,
greatly changed between Augustus and Domitian. Men of
good birth and education, and sometimes even of high official
position (Juv. i. 117), accepted the dole (<i>sportula</i>). Martial
was merely following a general fashion in paying his court
to &ldquo;a lord,&rdquo; and he made the best of the custom. In his earlier
career he used to accompany his patrons to their villas at Baiae
or Tibur, and to attend their morning levées. Later on he
went to his own small country house, near Nomentum, and
sent a poem, or a small volume of his poems, as his representative
at the early visit. The fault of grossness Martial shares with
nearly all ancient and many modern writers who treat of life
from the baser or more ridiculous side. That he offends more
than perhaps any of them is not, apparently, to be explained on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page790" id="page790"></a>790</span>
the ground that he had to amuse a peculiarly corrupt public.
Although there is the most cynical effrontery and want of self-respect
in Martial&rsquo;s use of language, there is not much trace of the
satyr in him&mdash;much less, many readers will think, than in Juvenal.</p>

<p>It remains to ask, What were those qualities of nature and
intellect which enable us to read his best work&mdash;even the great
body of his work&mdash;with the freshest sense of pleasure in the
present day? He had the keenest capacity for enjoyment,
the keenest curiosity and power of observation. He had also
a very just discernment. It is rare to find any one endowed
with so quick a perception of the ridiculous who is so little
of a caricaturist. He was himself singularly free from cant,
pedantry or affectation of any kind. Though tolerant of most
vices, he had a hearty scorn of hypocrisy. There are few better
satirists of social and literary pretenders in ancient or modern
times. Living in a very artificial age, he was quite natural,
hating pomp and show, and desiring to secure in life only what
really gave him pleasure. To live one&rsquo;s own life heartily from
day to day without looking before or after, and to be one&rsquo;s
self without trying to be that for which nature did not
intend him, is the sum of his philosophy. Further, while
tolerant of much that is bad and base&mdash;the characters of
Crispinus and Regulus, for instance&mdash;he shows himself genuinely
grateful for kindness and appreciative of excellence. He has
no bitterness, malice or envy in his composition. He professes
to avoid personalities in his satire;&mdash;&ldquo;Ludimus innocui&rdquo;
is the character he claims for it. Pliny, in the short tribute
which he pays to him on hearing of his death, says, &ldquo;He had
as much good-nature as wit and pungency in his writings&rdquo;
(<i>Ep.</i> iii. 21).</p>

<p>Honour and sincerity (<i>fides</i> and <i>simplicitas</i>) are the qualities
which he most admires in his friends. Though many of his
epigrams indicate a cynical disbelief in the character of women,
yet others prove that he could respect and almost reverence
a refined and courteous lady. His own life in Rome afforded
him no experience of domestic virtue; but his epigrams show
that, even in the age which is known to modern readers chiefly
from the <i>Satires</i> of Juvenal, virtue was recognized as the purest
source of happiness. The tenderest element in Martial&rsquo;s nature
seems, however, to have been his affection for children and for
his dependents.</p>

<p>The permanent literary interest of Martial&rsquo;s epigrams arises
not so much from their verbal brilliancy, though in this they
are unsurpassed, as from the amount of human life and character
which they contain. He, better than any other writer, enables
us to revive the outward spectacle of the imperial Rome. If
Juvenal enforces the lesson of that time, and has penetrated
more deeply into the heart of society, Martial has sketched
its external aspect with a much fairer pencil and from a much
more intimate contact with it. Martial was to Rome in the
decay of its ancient virtue and patriotism what Menander
was to Athens in its decline. They were both men of cosmopolitan
rather than of a national type, and had a closer affinity
to the life of Paris or London in the 18th century than to that
of Rome in the days of the Scipios or of Athens in the age
of Pericles. The form of epigram was fitted to the critical
temper of Rome as the comedy of manners was fitted to the
dramatic genius of Greece. Martial professes to be of the school
of Catullus, Pedo, and Marsus, and admits his inferiority only
to the first. But, though he is a poet of a less pure and genuine
inspiration he is a greater epigrammatist even than his master.
Indeed the epigram bears to this day the form impressed upon
it by his unrivalled skill.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;The MSS. of Martial are divided by editors into
three families according to the recension of the text which they offer.
Of these the oldest and best is represented by three MSS. which
contain only selected extracts. The second family is derived from
an inferior source, a MS. which was edited in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 401 by Torquatus
Gennadius; it comprises four MSS. and contains the whole of the
text. The third family, of which the MSS. are very numerous, also
contains the whole of the text in a recension slightly different from
that of the other two; the best representative of this family is the
MS. preserved in the Advocates&rsquo; Library at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The best separate edition of the text is that of Lindsay (Oxford,
1902); earlier editions of importance are those of Schneidewin
(1842 and 1853), and of Gilbert (Leipzig, 1886). The best commentary
is that of L. Friedländer (Leipzig, 1886) in two volumes with
German notes) and in the same scholar&rsquo;s <i>Sittengeschichte Roms</i> much
will be found that explains and illustrates Martial&rsquo;s epigrams.
There is a large selection from the epigrams with English notes by
Paley and Stone (1875), a smaller selection with notes by Stephenson
(1880); see also Edwin Post, <i>Selected Epigrams of Martial</i> (1908),
with introduction and notes. The translation into English verse
by Elphinston (London, 1782) is famous for its absurdity, which
drew an epigram from Burns.</p>

treat of apples, peaches, quinces, almonds and chestnuts.
Gargilius also wrote a treatise on the tending of cattle (<i>De curis

<p><span class="bold">MARTIAL LAW.<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> &ldquo;Martial law&rdquo; is an unfortunate term
and in a sense a misnomer. It describes a suspension of ordinary
law, rendered necessary by circumstances of war or rebellion.
The confusion arose from the fact that the marshal&rsquo;s court
administered military law before the introduction of articles
of war, which were in their turn merged in the Army Act.
But martial law is not a law in the proper sense of the term.
It is the exercise of the will of the military commander, who
takes upon himself the responsibility of suspending ordinary
law in order to ensure the safety of the state. It is declared,
by a proclamation issued by the executive, that ordinary law
is inadequate to cope with the circumstances, and provides
exceptional means of arrest and punishment of persons who
resist the government or aid the enemy. But such a proclamation,
while invariably issued in order to give publicity to the
suspension of ordinary law, does not invest the step with the
force of law. It is simply military authority exercised in
accordance with the laws and usages of war, and is limited
by military necessity. Yet in reality it is part of common law
which justifies acts done by necessity for the defence of the
commonwealth when there is war. H. W. Halleck in his work
on International Law (i. 544), says, &ldquo;Martial law originates
either in the prerogative of the crown, as in Great Britain, or
from the exigency of the occasion, as in other states: it is one
of the rights of sovereignty, and is essential to the existence
of a state, as is the right to declare or to carry on war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This opinion, however, must be read, as regards the British
Empire, with the passage in the Petition of Right which is
reproduced in the preamble of each annual Army Act, and
asserts the illegality of martial law in time of peace in the
following terms:&mdash;&ldquo;No man shall be fore-judged or subjected
in time of peace to any kind of punishment within this realm
by martial law.&rdquo; Therefore, whilst martial law is declared
illegal in time of peace, it is indirectly declared lawful in time
of war and intestinal commotion when the courts are closed,
or when there is no time for their cumbrous action. C. M.
Clode, in <i>Military Forces of the Crown</i>, argues that the words
of the Petition of Right and of the Military Act since the reign
of Anne are plain in this respect &ldquo;that ... the crown possesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page791" id="page791"></a>791</span>
the right of issuing commissions in war and rebellion.&rdquo; But
he rightly adds that the military commander may permit the
usual courts to continue their jurisdiction upon such subjects
as he thinks proper. Legislative enactments have also sanctioned
this special jurisdiction at various times, notably in
1798, 1799, 1801, and in 1803. These enactments lay down
that exceptional powers may be exercised &ldquo;whether the ordinary
courts shall or shall not be open.&rdquo; As an invariable rule
an act of indemnity has been passed on the withdrawal of
martial law, but only to protect any person in charge of the
execution of martial law who has exceeded his powers in good
faith.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion as to whether, in districts
where martial law has not been proclaimed, a person can be
sent for trial from such district into a district where martial
law was in operation. It is argued that if the ordinary courts
were open and at work in the non-proclaimed district recourse
should be had to them. The Privy Council in 1902 (<i>re</i> Marais)
refused leave to appeal where the Supreme Court of Cape Colony
had declined to issue a writ of Habeas Corpus in these circumstances.
Mr Justice Blackburn in his charge in <i>R.</i> v. <i>Eyre</i>
says, &ldquo;I have come to the conclusion that, looking at what
martial law was, the bringing of a person into the proclaimed
district to be tried might, in a proper case, be justified.&rdquo; The
learned judge admits that there should be a power of summary
trial, observing all the substantials of justice, in order to stamp
out an insurrection by speedy trial.</p>

<p>Whilst martial law is the will of the commanders, and is
only limited by the customs of war and the discretion of those
who administer it, still, as far as practicable, the procedure
of military law is followed, and a military court is held on the
same lines as a court-martial. Charges are simply framed
without technicalities. The prisoner is present, the evidence
of prosecution and prisoner is taken on oath, the proceedings
are recorded, and the sentence of the court must be confirmed
according to the rules of the Army Act. Sentences of death
and penal servitude must be referred to headquarters for confirmation.
In the South African War (1899-1902) these limits
of procedure were observed, and when possible will always be.</p>

<p>Entering more into detail, the term martial law has been
employed in several senses:&mdash;(1) As applied to the military
forces of the crown, apart from the military law
under the old Mutiny Acts, and the present annual
<span class="sidenote">Different Applications of Martial Law.</span>
Army Acts. (2) As applied to the enemy. (3)
As applied to rebels. (4) As applied to civilian
subjects who are not in rebellion, but in a district where the
ordinary course of civil life cannot be maintained owing to
war or rebellion.</p>

<p>1. In regard to the military forces of the crown, the superseding
of justice as administered under the Army Act could only occur
in a time of great need; <i>e.g.</i> mutiny of five or six regiments in
the field, with no time to take the opinion of any executive
authority. The officer in command would then be bound to
take measures for the purpose of suppressing such mutiny,
even to putting soldiers to death if necessary. It would be
a case where necessity forced immediate action.</p>

<p>2. Martial law as applied to the enemy or the population of
the enemy&rsquo;s country, is in the words of the duke of Wellington,
&ldquo;the will of the general of the army, though it must be
administered in accordance with the customs of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3, 4. But it is as affecting the subjects of the crown in rebellion
that the subject of martial law really obtains its chief importance;
and it is in this sense that the term is generally used; <i>i.e.</i> the
suspension of ordinary law and the temporary government of
the country, or parts of it, or all of it, by military tribunals.
It has often been laid down that martial law in this sense is
unknown to the law of England. A. V. Dicey, for instance,
restricts martial law to only another expression for &ldquo;the common
right of the crown and its servants to repel force by force,
in the case of invasion, insurrection, or riot, or generally of
any violent resistance.&rdquo; But more than this is understood
by the term martial law.</p>

<p>When the proposition was laid down that martial law in
this sense is unknown to the law of England, it is to be remembered
that fortunately in England there never had been a
state at all similar to that prevailing in Cape Colony in 1900-1902,
and it may perhaps be questioned whether the statement
would have been made with such certainty if similar events
had been present to the writers&rsquo; minds.</p>

<p>In the charge delivered by Mr Justice Blackburn in the
Jamaica case the law as affecting the general question of martial
law is well set out.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;By the laws of this country,&rdquo; said Mr Justice Blackburn, &ldquo;beginning
at Magna Carta and getting more and more established,
down to the time of the Revolution, when it was finally and completely
established, the general rule was that a subject was not to
be tried or punished except by due course of law; all crimes are to be
determined by juries subject to the guidance of the judge; that is
the general rule, and is established law. But from the earliest
times there was this also which was the law, and is the law still, that
when there was a foreign invasion or an insurrection, it was the duty
of every good subject, in obedience to the officers and magistrates,
to resist the rebels, ... in such a case as that of insurrection prevailing
so far that the courts of law cannot sit, there must really be
anarchy unless there is some power to keep the people in order, ... before
that principle the crown claimed the prerogative to exercise
summary proceedings by martial law ... in time of war when this
disturbance was going on, over others than the army. And further
than that, the crown made this further claim against the insurgents,
that whilst it existed, pending the insurrection and for a short time
afterwards, the crown had ... the power to proclaim martial law
in the sense of using summary proceedings, to punish the insurgents
and to check and stop the spread of the rebellion by summary proceedings
against the insurgents, so as ... to stamp out the rebellion.
Now no doubt the extent to which the crown had power to do that
has never been yet decided. Our law has been declared from time
to time and has always been a practical science, that is, the judges
have decided so much as was necessary for the particular case, and
that has become part of the law. But it never has come to be decided
what this precise power is.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So far as the United Kingdom is concerned the need has
never arisen. It has always been found possible to employ
the ordinary courts directly the rebels have been defeated in
the field and have been made prisoners or surrendered. &ldquo;Fortunately
in England only three occasions have arisen since the
Revolution when the authority of the civil power was for a time,
and then only partially, suspended,&rdquo; 1715, 1745 and 1780.
Clode, <i>Military Forces</i>, ii. 163, says: &ldquo;Upon the threat of
invasion followed by rebellion in 1715, the first action of the
government was to issue a proclamation authorizing all officers,
civil and military, by force of arms (if necessary) to suppress
the rebellion.&rdquo; This, therefore, would only seem to fall within
the limited sense in which Dicey understands martial law to be
legal, &ldquo;the right of the crown and its servants to repel force
by force.&rdquo; There was no attempt to bring persons before
courts-martial who ought to be tried by the common law, and
all the extraordinary acts of the crown were sanctioned by
parliament. After the rebellion had been suppressed two
statutes were passed, one for indemnity and the other for
pardon. Before the revolution of 1745 similar action was
adopted, a proclamation charging civil magistrates to do their
utmost to prevent and suppress all riots, and acts of parliament
suspending Habeas Corpus, providing for speedy trials; and
of indemnity. In the Gordon Riots of 1780 a very similar
course was pursued, and nothing was done which would not
fall within Dicey&rsquo;s limitation. No prisoners were tried by
martial law.</p>

<p>In Ireland the ordinary law was suspended in 1798-1801
and in 1803. In 1798 an order in Council was issued to all
general officers commanding H.M. forces to punish all persons
acting in, aiding, or in any way assisting the rebellion, according
to <i>martial law</i>, either by death or otherwise, as to them should
seem expedient for the suppression and punishment of all
rebels; but the order was communicated to the Irish houses of
parliament, who expressed their approval by addresses to the
viceroy. It was during the operation of this order that Wolfe
Tone&rsquo;s case arose. Tone, a subject of the king, was captured
on board a French man-of-war, and condemned to death by
a court-martial. Curran, his counsel, applied to the king&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page792" id="page792"></a>792</span>
bench at Dublin for a Habeas Corpus, on the grounds that
only when war was raging could courts-martial be endured,
not while the court of king&rsquo;s bench sat. The court granted
his application; but no ultimate decision was ever given, as
Tone died before it could be arrived at.</p>

<p>In 1799 application was made to parliament for express
sanction to martial law. The preamble of the act declared
that &ldquo;The Rebellion still continues ... and stopped the
ordinary course of justice and of the common law; and that
many persons ... who had been taken by H.M. forces ...
have availed themselves of such partial restoration of the ordinary
course of the common law to evade the punishment of their
crimes, whereby it had become necessary for parliament to
interfere.&rdquo; The act declared that martial law should prevail
and be put in force whether the ordinary courts were or were
not open, &amp;c. And nothing in the act could be held to take
away, abridge or eliminate the acknowledged prerogative of
war, for the public safety to resort to the exercise of martial
law against open enemies or traitors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>After the suppression of the rebellion an act of indemnity
was passed in 1801.</p>

<p>In 1803 a similar act was passed by the parliament of the
United Kingdom as it was after the Act of Union. In introducing

de</span> (1778-1832), French statesman, was born at Bordeaux on
the 20th of June 1778. In 1798 he acted as secretary to Sieyès;
then after serving for a while in the army, he turned to literature,
producing several light plays. Under the Empire he practised
with success as an advocate at Bordeaux, where in 1818 he
became advocate-general of the <i>cour royale</i>. In 1819 he was
appointed <i>procureur-général</i> at Limoges, and in 1821 was returned
for Marmande to the Chamber of Deputies, where he supported
the policy of Villèle. In 1822 he was appointed councillor
of state, in 1823 he accompanied the due d&rsquo;Angoulême to Spain
as civil commissary; in 1824 he was created a viscount and
appointed director-general of registration. In contact with
practical politics his ultra-royalist views were gradually modified
in the direction of the Doctrinaires, and on the fall of Villèle
he was selected by Charles X. to carry out the new policy of
compromise. On the 4th of January 1828 he was appointed
minister of the interior, and, though not bearing the title of
president, became the virtual head of the cabinet. He succeeded
in passing the act abolishing the press censorship, and in persuading
the king to sign the ordinances of the 16th of June 1828 on
the Jesuits and the little seminaries. He was exposed to attack
from both the extreme Left and the extreme Right, and when
in April 1829 a coalition of these groups defeated him in the
chamber, Charles X., who had never believed in the policy
he represented, replaced him by the prince, de Polignac. In
March 1830 Martignac voted with the majority for the address
protesting against the famous ordinances; but during the
revolution that followed he remained true to his legitimist
principles. His last public appearance was in defence of Polignac
in the Chamber of Peers in December 1830. He died on the
3rd of April 1832.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN, ST<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 316-400), bishop of Tours, was born of
heathen parents at Sabaria (Stein am Agger) in Pannonia, about
the year 316. When ten years old he became a catechumen,
and at fifteen he reluctantly entered the army. While stationed
at Amiens he divided his cloak with a beggar, and on the following
night had the vision of Christ making known to his angels
this act of charity to Himself on the part of &ldquo;Martinus, still
a catechumen.&rdquo; Soon afterwards he received baptism, and
two years later, having left the army, he joined Hilary of Poitiers,
who wished to make him a deacon, but at his own request
ordained him to the humbler office of an exorcist. On a visit
home he converted his mother, but his zeal against the Arians
roused persecution against him and for some time he lived
an ascetic life on the desert island of Gallinaria near Genoa.
Between 360 and 370 he was again with Hilary at Poitiers, and
founded in the neighbourhood the monasterium locociagense
(Licugé). In 371-372 the people of Tours chose him for their
bishop. He did much to extirpate idolatry from his diocese
and from France, and to extend the monastic system. To
obtain privacy for the maintenance of his personal religion, he
established the monastery of Marmoutier-les-Tours (Martini
monasterium) on the banks of the Loire. At Trèves, in 385,
he entreated that the lives of the Priscillianist heretics should
be spared, and he ever afterwards refused to hold ecclesiastical
fellowship with those bishops who had sanctioned their execution.
He died at Candes in the year 400, and is commemorated by
the Roman Church on the 11th of November (duplex). He left
no writings, the so-called <i>Confessio</i> being spurious. He is the
patron saint of France and of the cities of Mainz and Würzburg.
The <i>Life</i> by his disciple Sulpicius Severus is practically the
only source for his biography, but it is full of legendary matter
and chronological errors. Gregory of Tours gives a list of 206
miracles wrought by him after his death; Sidonius Apollinaris
composed a metrical biography of him. The Feast of St Martin
(Martinmas) took the place of an old pagan festival, and inherited
some of its usages (such as the <i>Martinsmännchen</i>, <i>Martinsfeuer</i>,
<i>Martinshorn</i> and the like, in various parts of Germany); by
this circumstance is probably to be explained the fact that
Martin is regarded as the patron of drinking and jovial meetings,
as well as of reformed drunkards.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Martin I.</span> succeeded Theodore I. in June or July 649. He
had previously acted as papal apocrisiarius at Constantinople,
and was held in high repute for learning and virtue. Almost
his first official act was to summon a synod (the first Lateran)
for dealing with the Monothelite heresy. It met in the Lateran
church, was attended by one hundred and five bishops (chiefly
from Italy, Sicily and Sardinia, a few being from Africa and
other quarters), held five sessions or &ldquo;secretarii&rdquo; from the
5th to the 31st of October 649, and in twenty canons condemned
the Monothelite heresy, its authors, and the writings by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page793" id="page793"></a>793</span>
it had been promulgated. In this condemnation were included,
not only the <i>Ecthesis</i> or exposition of faith of the patriarch
Sergius for which the emperor Heraclius had stood sponsor,
but also the Typus of Paul, the successor of Sergius, which
had the support of the reigning emperor (Constans II.). Martin
published the decrees of his Lateran synod in an encyclical,
and Constans replied by enjoining his exarch to seize the pope
and send him prisoner to Constantinople. Martin was arrested
in the Lateran (June 15, 653), hurried out of Rome, and
conveyed first to Naxos and subsequently to Constantinople
(Sept. 17, 654). He was ultimately banished to Cherson, where
he arrived on the 26th of March 655, and died on the 16th of
September following. His successor was Eugenius I.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Martin IV.</span> (Simon Mompitié de Brion), pope from the 22nd
of February 1281 to the 28th of March 1285, should have been
named Martin II. He was born about 1210 in Touraine. He
became a priest at Rouen and canon of St Martin&rsquo;s at Tours,
and was made chancellor of France by Louis IX. in 1260 and
cardinal-priest of Sta Cecilia by Urban IV. in 1261. As papal
legate in France he held several synods for the reformation of
the clergy and conducted the negotiations for the assumption
of the crown of Sicily by Charles of Anjou. It was through
the latter&rsquo;s influence that he succeeded Nicholas III., after a
six-months&rsquo; struggle between the French and Italian cardinals.
The Romans at first declined to receive him, and he was consecrated
at Orvieto on the 23rd of March 1281. Peaceful
and unassuming, he relied completely on Charles of Anjou,
and showed little ability as pope. His excommunication of
the emperor Michael Palaeologus (Nov. 1281), who stood
in the way of the French projects against Greece, weakened
the union with the Eastern Christians, dating from the Lyons
Council of 1274. He unduly favoured his own countrymen,
and for three years after the Sicilian Vespers (Mar. 31, 1282)
he employed all the spiritual and material resources at his command
on behalf of his patron against Peter of Aragon. He
was driven from Rome by a popular uprising and died at Perugia.
His successor was Honorius IV.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Martin V.</span> (Otto Colonna) (1417-1431) was elected at Constance
on St Martin&rsquo;s Day, in a conclave composed of twenty-three
cardinals and thirty delegates from the five different
&ldquo;nations&rdquo; of the council. Son of Agapito Colonna, who had
himself become a bishop and cardinal, the new pope belonged to
one of the greatest Roman families; to Urban VI. had been
due his entry, as <i>referendarius</i>, upon an ecclesiastical career.
Having become a cardinal under Innocent VII., he had
seceded from Gregory XII. in 1408, and together with the other
cardinals at Pisa, had taken part in the election of Alexander V.
and afterwards of John XXIII. At Constance, his rôle had
been chiefly that of an arbiter; he was a good and gentle man,
leading a simple life, free from intrigue. While refraining
from making any pronouncement as to the validity of the decrees
of the fourth and fifth sessions, which had seemed to proclaim the
superiority of the council over the pope, Martin V. nevertheless
soon revealed his personal feelings by having a constitution
read in consistory which forbade any appeal from the judgment
of the sovereign pontiff in matters of faith (May 10, 1418).
As to the reform, of which everybody felt the necessity, the
fathers in council had not succeeded in arriving at any agreement.
Martin V. himself settled a great number of points, and then
passed a series of special concordats with Germany, France,
Italy, Spain and England. Though this was not the thorough
reform of which need was felt, the council itself gave the pope
a <i>satisfecit</i>. When the council was dissolved Martin V. made it
his task to regain Italy. After staying for long periods at
Mantua and Florence, where the deposed pope, Baldassare
Cossa (John XXIII.), came and made submission to him, Martin
V. was enabled to enter Rome (Sept. 30, 1420) and measure
the extent of the ruins left there by the Great Schism of the
West. He set to work to restore some of these ruins, to reconstitute
and pacify the Papal State, to put an end to the Schism,
which showed signs of continuing in Aragon and certain parts
of southern France; to enter into negotiations, unfortunately
unfruitful, with the Greek Church also with a view to a return
to unity, to organize the struggle against heresy in Bohemia;
to interpose his pacific mediation between France and England,
as well as between the parties which were rending France;
and, finally, to welcome and act as patron to saintly reformers
like Bernardino of Siena and Francesca Romana,
foundress of the nursing sisterhood of the Oblate di Tor de&rsquo;
Specchi (1425).</p>

<p>In accordance with the decree <i>Frequens</i>, and the promises
which he had made, Martin V., after an interval of five years,
summoned a new council, which was almost immediately
transferred from Pavia to Siena, in consequence of an epidemic
(1423). But the small number of fathers who attended at the
latter town, and above all, the disquieting tendencies which
began to make themselves felt there, induced the pope to force
on a dissolution of the synod. Pending the reunion of the new
council which had been summoned at Basel for the end of a
period of seven years, Martin V. himself endeavoured to effect a
reformation in certain points, but he was carried off by apoplexy
(Feb. 20, 1431), just as he had designated the young and brilliant
Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini to preside in his place over the council
of Basel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN, BON LOUIS HENRI<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1810-1883), French historian,
was born on the 20th of February 1810 at St Quentin (Aisne),
where his father was a judge. Trained as a notary, he followed
this profession for some time but having achieved success with
an historical romance, <i>Wolfthurm</i> (1830), he applied himself
to historical research. Becoming associated with Paul Lacroix
(&ldquo;le Bibliophile Jacob&rdquo;), he planned with him a history of
France, to consist of excerpts from the chief chroniclers and
historians, with original matter filling up gaps in the continuity.
The first volume, which appeared in 1833, encouraged the
author to make the work his own, and his <i>Histoire de France</i>,
in fifteen volumes (1833-1836), was the result. This <i>magnum
opus</i>, rewritten and further elaborated (4th ed., 16 vols. and
index, 1861-1865) gained for the author in 1856 the first prize of
the Academy, and in 1869 the grand biennial prize of 20,000
francs. A popular abridgment in seven volumes was published
in 1867. This, together with the continuation, <i>Histoire de
France depuis 1789 jusqu&rsquo;à nos jours</i> (6 vols. 1878-1883), gives
a complete history of France, and superseded Sismondi&rsquo;s <i>Histoire
des Français</i>.</p>

<p>This work is in parts defective; Martin&rsquo;s descriptions of the
Gauls are based rather on romance than on history, and in
this respect he was too much under the influence of Jean Reynaud
and his cosmogonic philosophy. However he gave a great
impetus to Celtic and anthropological studies. His knowledge
of the <span class="correction" title="amended from mddile">middle</span> ages is inadequate, and his criticisms are not
discriminating. As a free-thinking republican, his prejudices
often biassed his judgment on the political and religious history
of the <i>ancien régime</i>. The last six volumes, devoted to the
17th and 18th centuries, are superior to the earlier ones. Martin
sat in the <i>assemblée nationale</i> as deputy for Aisne in 1871,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page794" id="page794"></a>794</span>
and was elected life senator in 1878, but he left no mark as a
politician. He died in Paris on the 14th of December 1883.</p>

like others of his countrymen, to have accepted service in the
Bengal army of the English, obtaining an ensign&rsquo;s commission
in 1763, and steadily rising to the rank of major-general. He was
employed on the building of the new Fort William at Calcutta,
and afterwards on the survey of Bengal under Rennell. In
1776 he was allowed to accept the appointment of superintendent
of the arsenal of the nawab of Oudh at Lucknow, retaining his

and before the close of the American war of Independence
went to North Carolina, where (in New Bern) he taught French
and learnt English, and set up as a printer. He studied law,
and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1789. He
published various legal books, and edited <i>Acts of the North
Carolina Assembly from 1715 to 1803</i> (2nd ed., 1809). He
was a member of the lower house of the General Assembly
in 1806-1807. In 1809 he was commissioned a judge of the
superior court of the territory of Mississippi, and in March
1810 became judge of the superior court of the territory of
Orleans. Here the law was in a chaotic condition, what with
French law before O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s rule, then a Spanish code, and in
1808 the Digest of the Civil Laws, an adaptation by James
Brown and Moreau Lislet of the code of Napoleon, which
repealed the Spanish fueros, partidas, recopilationes and
laws of the Indies only as they conflicted with its provisions.
Martin published in 1811 and 1813 reports of cases decided by
the superior court of the territory of Orleans. For two years
from February 1813 Martin was attorney-general of the
newly established state of Louisiana, and then until March 1846
was a judge and (from 1836 to 1846) presiding judge of the
supreme court of the state. For the period until 1830 he
published reports of the decisions of the supreme court; and in
1816 he published two volumes, one French and one English, of
<i>A General Digest of the Acts of Legislatures of the Late Territory
of Orleans and of the State of Louisiana</i>. He won the name of
the &ldquo;father of Louisiana jurisprudence&rdquo; and his work was of
great assistance to Edward Livingston, Pierre Derbigny and
Moreau Lislet in the Louisiana codification of 1821-1826.

heraldic painting, but owing to a quarrel the indentures were
cancelled, and he was placed under Bonifacio Musso, an Italian
artist, father of the enamel painter Charles Musso. With his
master Martin removed to London in 1806, where he married
at the age of nineteen, and supported himself by giving drawing
lessons, and by painting in water colours, and on china and
glass. His leisure was occupied in the study of perspective and
architecture. His first picture, &ldquo;Sadak in Search of the Waters
of Oblivion,&rdquo; was exhibited in the Royal Academy of 1812, and
sold for fifty guineas. It was followed by the &ldquo;Expulsion&rdquo; (1813),
&ldquo;Paradise&rdquo; (1813), &ldquo;Clytie&rdquo; (1814), and &ldquo;Joshua&rdquo; (1815). In 1821
appeared his &ldquo;Belshazzar&rsquo;s Feast,&rdquo; which excited much favourable
and hostile comment, and was awarded a prize of £200 at the
British Institution, where the Joshua had previously carried off a
premium of £100. Then came the &ldquo;Destruction of Herculaneum&rdquo;
(1822), the &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; (1824), the &ldquo;Eve of the Deluge&rdquo; (1841),
and a series of other Biblical and imaginative subjects. In 1832-1833
Martin received £2000 for drawing and engraving a fine
series of designs to Milton, and with Westall he produced a set of
Bible illustrations. He was also occupied with schemes for
the improvement of London, and published various pamphlets
and plans dealing with the metropolitan water supply, sewage,
dock and railway systems. During the last four years of his
life he was engaged upon his large subjects of &ldquo;The Judgment,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Day of Wrath,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Plains of Heaven.&rdquo; He was
attacked with paralysis while painting, and died in the Isle of
Man on the 17th of February 1854.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN, LUTHER<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1748-1826), American lawyer, was
born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on the 9th of February
1748. He graduated at the college of New Jersey (now Princeton
University) at the head of a class of thirty-five in 1766, and
immediately afterwards removed to Maryland, teaching at
Queenstown in that colony until 1770, and being admitted to
the bar in 1771. He practised law for a short time in Virginia,
then returned to Maryland, and became recognized as the leader
of the Maryland bar and as one of the ablest lawyers in the United
States. From 1778 to 1805 he was attorney-general of Maryland;
in 1814-1816 he was chief judge of the court of Oyer and
Terminer for the city of Baltimore; and in 1818-1822 he was
attorney-general of Maryland. He was one of Maryland&rsquo;s
representatives in the Continental Congress in 1784-1785 and
in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 at Philadelphia, but
opposed the constitution and refused to affix his signature. He
subsequently allied himself with the Federalists, and was an
opponent of Thomas Jefferson, who in 1807 spoke of him as the
&ldquo;Federal Bull-Dog.&rdquo; His ability was shown in his famous defence
of Judge Samuel Chase (<i>q.v.</i>) in the impeachment trial before the
United States Senate in 1804-1805, and in his defence of Aaron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page795" id="page795"></a>795</span>
Burr (<i>q.v.</i>) against the charge of treason in 1807. He has been
described by the historian Henry Adams, writing of the Chase
trial, as at that time the &ldquo;most formidable of American advocates.&rdquo;
Though he received a large income, he was so improvident
that he was frequently in want, and on the 22nd of
February 1822 the legislature of Maryland passed a remarkable
resolution&mdash;the only one of the kind in American history&mdash;requiring
every lawyer in the state to pay an annual licence
fee of five dollars, to be handed over to trustees appointed &ldquo;for
the appropriation of the proceeds raised by virtue of this resolution
to the use of Luther Martin.&rdquo; This resolution was
rescinded on the 6th of February 1823. Martin died at the
home of Aaron Burr in New York on the 10th of July 1826.
In 1783 he had married a daughter of the Captain Michael
Cresap (1742-1775), who was unjustly charged by Jefferson,
in his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>, with the murder of the family of
the Indian chief, John Logan, and whom Martin defended in
a pamphlet long out of print.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN, SIR THEODORE<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1816-1909), British author and
translator, the son of a solicitor, was born at Edinburgh on the
16th of September 1816, and educated at the Royal High School
and the University, from which he subsequently received the
honorary degree of LL.D. He practised for some time as a
solicitor in Edinburgh, but in 1846 went to London, where he
became senior partner in the firm of Martin &amp; Leslie, parliamentary
agents. He early contributed to <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>
and <i>Tait&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, under the signature of &ldquo;Bon Gaultier,&rdquo;
and in 1856, in conjunction with Professor Aytoun, he published
the <i>Book of Ballads</i> under the same pseudonym. This work at
once obtained popular favour. In 1858 he published a volume of
translations of the <i>Poems and Ballads of Goethe</i>, and this was
followed by a rendering of the Danish poet Henrik Hertz&rsquo;s
lyric drama, <i>King René&rsquo;s Daughter</i>. The principal character in
this drama, Iolanthe, was sustained by Helena Faucit (<i>q.v.</i>),
who in 1851 became the author&rsquo;s wife. Martin&rsquo;s translations of
Öhlenschläger&rsquo;s dramas, <i>Correggio</i> (1854) and <i>Aladdin, or the
Wonderful Lamp</i> (1857), widened the fame of the Danish poet in
England. In 1860 appeared Martin&rsquo;s metrical translation of the
<i>Odes of Horace</i>; and in 1870 he wrote a volume on <i>Horace</i> for the
series of &ldquo;Ancient Classics for English Readers.&rdquo; In 1882 his
Horatian labours were concluded by a translation of the poet&rsquo;s
whole works, with a life and notes, in two volumes. A poetical
translation of <i>Catullus</i> was published in 1861, followed by a
privately printed volume of <i>Poems, Original and Translated</i>, in
1863. <span class="correction" title="amended from The">Then</span> came translations of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> of Dante, and
the first part of Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. A metrical translation of the
second part of <i>Faust</i> appeared in 1866. Martin wrote a memoir
of his friend Aytoun in 1867, and while engaged upon this work
he was requested by Queen Victoria, to whom he was introduced
by his friend Sir Arthur Helps, to undertake the <i>Life of His
Royal Highness the Prince Consort</i>. The first volume of this
well-known work was published in 1874. In 1878 Martin&rsquo;s
translation of Heine&rsquo;s <i>Poems and Ballads</i> appeared. Two years
later the <i>Life of the Prince Consort</i> was brought to a successful
conclusion by the publication of the fifth volume. A knighthood
was then conferred upon him. In the following November he was
elected lord rector of the university of St Andrews. Martin&rsquo;s
<i>Life of Lord Lyndhurst</i>, based upon papers furnished by the family,
was published in 1883. In 1889 appeared <i>The Song of the Bell,
and other Translations from Schiller, Goethe, Uhland, and Others</i>;
in 1804 <i>Madonna Pia, a Tragedy, and three Other Dramas</i>; a
translation of Leopardi&rsquo;s poems in 1905; and in 1901 he published
a biography of his wife. The kindly relations which subsisted
between Queen Victoria and Sir Theodore Martin were continued
after the completion of the <i>Life</i> of the prince consort up to
the queen&rsquo;s death. Sir Theodore&rsquo;s account of these relations
was privately printed in 1902, and, with King Edward&rsquo;s consent,
for general publication in 1908. This little book, <i>Queen Victoria
as I knew her</i>, throws a good deal of light on the Queen&rsquo;s
character and private life. Sir Theodore Martin died on the
18th of August 1909.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN, WILLIAM<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1767-1810), English naturalist, the son
of a hosier, was born at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in 1767.
He studied drawing at an early age from James Bolton at
Halifax, and gained from him a taste for the study of natural
history. In 1805 he was appointed drawing master in the grammar
school at Macclesfield. Meanwhile he cultivated his taste
for natural history, and was in 1796 elected a fellow of the
Linnaean Society. He is best known for his early works on
British fossils, entitled <i>Petrifacta derbiensia or Figures and
Descriptions of Petrifactions collected in Derbyshire</i> (1809); and
<i>Outlines of an Attempt to establish a Knowledge of Extraneous
Fossils on Scientific Principles</i> (1809). He died at Macclesfield on
the 31st of May 1810.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN, SIR WILLIAM FANSHAWE<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (1801-1895), British
admiral, son of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Thomas Byam Martin,
comptroller of the navy, and grandson, on the mother&rsquo;s side, of
Captain Robert Fanshawe, who commanded the &ldquo;Namur&rdquo; 90
in Rodney&rsquo;s victory of the 12th of April 1782, was born on the 5th
of December 1801. Entering the navy at the age of twelve,
his father&rsquo;s interest secured his rapid promotion: he was made
a lieutenant on the 15th of December 1820; on the 8th of
February 1823 he was promoted to be commander of the
&ldquo;Fly&rdquo; sloop, his good service in which in support of the interests
of British merchants at Callao secured his promotion
as captain on the 5th of June 1824. He afterwards served
in the Mediterranean and on the home station. In 1849-1852
he was commodore commanding the Channel squadron,
and gave evidence of a remarkable aptitude for command.
He was made rear-admiral in May 1853, and for the next four
years was superintendent of Portsmouth dockyard. He was
made vice-admiral in February 1858, and after a year as a lord
of the admiralty, was appointed commander-in-chief in the
Mediterranean. The discipline of the navy was then bad. It
was a tradition sprung from the wholesale shipment of gaol-birds
during the old war, that the men were to be treated without
consideration; moreover the ships had been largely filled up with
&ldquo;bounty men&rdquo; bought into the service with a £10 note without
training. Out of this unpromising material Martin formed the
fleet which was at that time the ideal of excellence. He had no
war service, and, beyond the Italian disturbance of 1860-61, no
opportunity for showing diplomatic ability. But his memory
lives as that of the reformer of discipline and the originator of a
comprehensive system of steam man&oelig;uvres. He became an
admiral in November 1863, and on the 4th of December succeeded
to the baronetcy which had been conferred on his grandfather.
His last appointment was the command at Plymouth, 1866-1869,
and in 1870 he was put on the retired list. In 1873 the G.C.B.
was conferred on him, and in 1878 he was made rear-admiral.
He died at Upton Grey, near Winchfield, on the 24th of March
1895. He was twice married, and left, besides daughters, one
son, who succeeded to the baronetcy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN OF TROPPAU,<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Martin the Pole</span> (d. 1278), chronicler,
was born at Troppau, and entered the order of St Dominic
at Prague. Afterwards he went to Rome and became papal
chaplain under Clement IV. and other popes. In 1278 Pope
Nicholas III. appointed him archbishop of Gnesen, but he died
at Bologna whilst proceeding to Poland to take up his new duties.
Martin wrote some sermons and some commentaries on the
canon law; but more important is his <i>Chronicon pontificum et
imperatorum</i>, a history of the popes and emperors to 1277.
Written at the request of Clement IV. the <i>Chronicon</i> is jejune
and untrustworthy, and was mainly responsible for the currency
of the legend of Pope Joan, and the one about the institution of
seven electors by the pope. Nevertheless it enjoyed an extraordinary
popularity and found many continuators; but its value
to students arises solely from the fact that it was used by
numerous chroniclers during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries.
In the 15th century it was translated into French, and as part of
the <i>Chronique martiniane</i> was often quoted by controversialists.
It has also been translated into German, Italian and Bohemian.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIN<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span><a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (Fr. <i>Martinet</i>), the <i>Hirundo urbica</i> of Linnaeus and
<i>Chelidon urbica</i> of modern ornithologists, a bird well known
throughout Europe, including even Lapland, where it is abundant,
retiring in winter to the south of Africa. It also inhabits
the western part of Asia, and appears from time to time in large
flocks in India. The martin (or house-martin, as it is often
called, to distinguish it from the sand-martin) commonly reaches
its summer quarters a few days later than the Swallow (<i>q.v.</i>),
with which it is often confused in spite of the differences
between them, the martin&rsquo;s white rump and lower parts being
conspicuous as it flies or clings to its nest attached to houses.
This nest, made of the same material as the swallow&rsquo;s, is, however,
a more difficult structure to rear, and a week or more is
often occupied in laying its foundations&mdash;the builders clinging
to the wall while depositing the mud of which it is composed.
The base once fixed, the superstructure is often quickly added,
till the whole takes the shape of the half or quarter of a hemisphere,
and is finished with a lining of feathers mixed with a few
bents or straws. The martin builds soon after its return, and a
nest that has outlasted the winter is almost at once reoccupied.
The bird usually in the course of the summer raises a second, or
rarely a third, brood of offspring&mdash;though the latest broods
often die in the nest, apparently through failure of food.
What seem to be adults are observed in England every year so
late as November, and sometimes within a few days of the
winter solstice, but these late birds are almost certainly
strangers.</p>

<p>The sand-martin, <i>Hirundo riparia</i> of Linnaeus and <i>Cotile
riparia</i> of modern writers, differs much in appearance and habits
from the former. Its smaller size, mouse-coloured upper surface
and jerking flight distinguish it from the other British <i>Hirundinidae</i>;
but it is seldom discriminated, and, being the first of
the family to return to its northern home, the so-called &ldquo;early
swallow&rdquo; is nearly always of this species. Instead of the clay-built
nest of the house-martin, this bird bores horizontal galleries
in an escarpment. When beginning its excavation, it clings to
the face of the bank, and with its bill loosens the earth, working
from the centre outwards, and often hanging head downwards.
The tunnel may extend to 4, 6, or even 9 ft. The gallery seems
intended to be straight, but inequalities of the ground, and especially
the meeting with stones, often causes it to take a sinuous
course. At the end is formed a nest lined with a few grass-stalks
and feathers. The sand-martin has several broods in the year,
and is more regular than other <i>Hirundinidae</i> in its departure for
the south. The kind of soil needed for its nesting habits makes
it somewhat local, but no species of the order <i>Passeres</i> has a
geographical range that can compare with this. In Europe it is
found nearly to the North Cape, and thence to the Sea of Okhotsk.
In winter it visits many parts of India and South Africa to the
Transvaal. In America its range extends (having due regard
to the season) from Melville Island to Caiçara in Brazil, and
from Newfoundland to Alaska.</p>

<p>The purple martin of America, <i>Progne purpurea</i>, is a favourite
in Canada and the United States. Naturally breeding in hollow
trees, it readily adapts itself to the nest-boxes which are commonly
set up for it; but its numbers are in some years and places
diminished in a manner unexplained. The limits of its range in
winter are not determined, chiefly owing to the differences of
opinion as to the validity of certain supposed kindred species
found in South America; but according to some authorities it
reaches the border of Patagonia, while in summer it is known to
inhabit lands within the Arctic Circle. The male is almost
wholly of a glossy steel-blue, while the female is duller in colour
above, and beneath of a brownish-grey.</p>

<p>Birds that may be called martins occur almost all over the
world except in New Zealand, which is not regularly inhabited
by any member of the family. The ordinary martin of Australia
is the <i>Petrochelidon nigricans</i> of most ornithologists, and another
and more beautiful form is the ariel or fairy-martin of the same
country, <i>Petrochelidon ariel</i>. This last builds a bottle-shaped
nest of mud, as does also the rock-martin of Europe, <i>Cotile
rupestris</i>. The eggs of martins are from four to seven in number,
and generally white, while those of swallows usually have
brown, grey or lilac markings.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINEAU, HARRIET<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1802-1876), English writer, was
born at Norwich, where her father was a manufacturer, on the
12th of June 1802. The family was of Huguenot extraction
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Martineau, James</a></span>) and professed Unitarian views. The
atmosphere of her home was industrious, intellectual and austere;
she herself was clever, but weakly and unhappy; she had no sense
of taste or smell, and moreover early grew deaf. At the age of
fifteen the state of her health and nerves led to a prolonged visit
to her father&rsquo;s sister, Mrs Kentish, who kept a school at Bristol.
Here, in the companionship of amiable and talented people, her
life became happier. Here, also, she fell under the influence of
the Unitarian minister, Dr Lant Carpenter, from whose instructions,
she says, she derived &ldquo;an abominable spiritual rigidity
and a truly respectable force of conscience strangely mingled
together.&rdquo; From 1819 to 1830 she again resided chiefly at
Norwich. About her twentieth year her deafness became confirmed.
In 1821 she began to write anonymously for the <i>Monthly
Repository</i>, a Unitarian periodical, and in 1823 she published
<i>Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns</i>.</p>

<p>In 1826 her father died, leaving a bare maintenance to his
wife and daughters. His death had been preceded by that of
his eldest son, and was shortly followed by that of a man to
whom Harriet was engaged. Mrs Martineau and her daughters
soon after lost all their means by the failure of the house where
their money was placed. Harriet had to earn her living, and,
being precluded by deafness from teaching, took up authorship
in earnest. Besides reviewing for the <i>Repository</i> she wrote
stories (afterwards collected as <i>Traditions of Palestine</i>), gained
in one year (1830) three essay-prizes of the Unitarian Association,
and eked out her income by needlework. In 1831 she was
seeking a publisher for a series of tales designed as <i>Illustrations
of Political Economy</i>. After many failures she accepted disadvantageous
terms from Charles Fox, to whom she was introduced
by his brother, the editor of the <i>Repository</i>. The sale of the first
of the series was immediate and enormous, the demand increased
with each new number, and from that time her literary success
was secured. In 1832 she moved to London, where she numbered
among her acquaintance Hallam, Milman, Malthus, Monckton
Milnes, Sydney Smith, Bulwer, and later Carlyle. Till 1834
she continued to be occupied with her political economy series
and with a supplemental series of <i>Illustrations of Taxation</i>.
Four stories dealing with the poor-law came out about the same
time. These tales, direct, lucid, written without any appearance
of effort, and yet practically effective, display the characteristics
of their author&rsquo;s style. In 1834, when the series was complete,
Miss Martineau paid a long visit to America. Here her
open adhesion to the Abolitionist party, then small and very
unpopular, gave great offence, which was deepened by the publication,
soon after her return, of <i>Society in America</i> (1837) and
a <i>Retrospect of Western Travel</i> (1838). An article in the <i>Westminster
Review</i>, &ldquo;The Martyr Age of the United States,&rdquo; introduced
English readers to the struggles of the Abolitionists. The
American books were followed by a novel, <i>Deerbrook</i> (1839)&mdash;a
story of middle-class country life. To the same period
belong a few little handbooks, forming parts of a <i>Guide to
Service</i>. The veracity of her <i>Maid of All Work</i> led to a widespread
belief, which she regarded with some complacency, that
she had once been a maid of all work herself.</p>

<p>In 1839, during a visit to the Continent, Miss Martineau&rsquo;s
health broke down. She retired to solitary lodgings in Tynemouth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page797" id="page797"></a>797</span>
and remained an invalid till 1844. Besides a novel, <i>The
Hour and the Man</i> (1840), <i>Life in the Sickroom</i> (1844), and the
<i>Playfellow</i> (1841), she published a series of tales for children
containing some of her most popular work: <i>Settlers at Home</i>,
<i>The Peasant and the Prince</i>, <i>Feats on the Fiord</i>, &amp;c. During this
illness she for a second time declined a pension on the civil list,
fearing to compromise her political independence. Her letter
on the subject was published, and some of her friends raised a
small annuity for her soon after.</p>

<p>In 1844 Miss Martineau underwent a course of mesmerism,
and in a few months was restored to health. She eventually
published an account of her case, which had caused much discussion,
in sixteen <i>Letters on Mesmerism</i>. On her recovery she
removed to Ambleside, where she built herself &ldquo;The Knoll,&rdquo; the
house in which the greater part of her after life was spent. In
1845 she published three volumes of <i>Forest and Game Law Tales</i>.
In 1846 she made a tour with some friends in Egypt, Palestine
and Syria, and on her return published <i>Eastern Life, Present
and Past</i> (1848). This work showed that as humanity passed
through one after another of the world&rsquo;s historic religions, the
conception of the Deity and of Divine government became at
each step more and more abstract and indefinite. The ultimate
goal Miss Martineau believed to be philosophic atheism, but this
belief she did not expressly declare. She published about this
time <i>Household Education</i>, expounding the theory that freedom
and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the
most effectual instruments of education. Her interest in
schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures,
addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterwards
extended, at their own desire, to their elders. The
subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the histories of
England and North America, and the scenes of her Eastern
travels. At the request of Charles Knight she wrote, in
1849, <i>The History of the Thirty Years&rsquo; Peace, 1816-1846</i>&mdash;an
excellent popular history written from the point of
view of a &ldquo;philosophical Radical,&rdquo; completed in twelve
months.</p>

<p>In 1851 Miss Martineau edited a volume of <i>Letters on the Laws
of Man&rsquo;s Nature and Development</i>. Its form is that of a correspondence
between herself and H. G. Atkinson, and it expounds
that doctrine of philosophical atheism to which Miss Martineau
in <i>Eastern Life</i> had depicted the course of human belief as
tending. The existence of a first cause is not denied, but is
declared unknowable, and the authors, while regarded by others
as denying it, certainly considered themselves to be affirming
the doctrine of man&rsquo;s moral obligation. Atkinson was a zealous
exponent of mesmerism, and the prominence given to the topics
of mesmerism and clairvoyance heightened the general disapprobation
of the book, which caused a lasting division between
Miss Martineau and some of her friends.</p>

<p>She published a condensed English version of the <i>Philosophie
Positive</i> (1853). To the <i>Daily News</i> she contributed regularly
from 1852 to 1866. Her <i>Letters from Ireland</i>, written during a
visit to that country in the summer of 1852, appeared in that
paper. She was for many years a contributor to the <i>Westminster
Review</i>, and was one of the little band of supporters whose
pecuniary assistance in 1854 prevented its extinction or forced
sale. In the early part of 1855 Miss Martineau found herself
suffering from heart disease. She now began to write her autobiography,
but her life, which she supposed to be so near its
close, was prolonged for twenty years. She died at &ldquo;The Knoll&rdquo;
on the 27th of June 1876.</p>

<p>She cultivated a tiny farm at Ambleside with success, and her
poorer neighbours owed much to her. Her busy life bears the
consistent impress of two leading characteristics&mdash;industry and
sincerity. The verdict which she records on herself in the
autobiographical sketch left to be published by the <i>Daily News</i>
has been endorsed by posterity. She says&mdash;&ldquo;Her original power
was nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual
clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and
suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius,
she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression
to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while
she could neither discover nor invent.&rdquo; Her judgment on large
questions was clear and sound, and was always the judgment of
a mind naturally progressive and Protestant.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINEAU, JAMES<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1805-1900), English philosopher and
divine, was born at Norwich on the 21st of April 1805, the
seventh child of Thomas Martineau and Elizabeth Rankin, the
sixth, his senior by almost three years, being his sister Harriet
(see above). He was descended from Gaston Martineau, a
Huguenot surgeon and refugee, who married in 1693 Marie Pierre,
and settled soon afterwards in Norwich. His son and grandson&mdash;respectively
the great-grandfather and grandfather of James
Martineau&mdash;were surgeons in the same city, while his father was
a manufacturer and merchant. James was educated at Norwich
Grammar School under Edward Valpy, as good a scholar as his
better-known brother Richard. But the boy proving too sensitive
for the life of a public day school, was sent to Bristol to the
private academy of Dr Lant Carpenter, under whom he studied
for two years. On leaving he was apprenticed to a civil engineer
at Derby, where he acquired &ldquo;a store of exclusively scientific
conceptions,&rdquo;<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but also experienced the hunger of mind which
forced him to look to religion for satisfaction. Hence came his
&ldquo;conversion,&rdquo; and the sense of vocation for the ministry which
impelled him in 1822 to enter Manchester College, then lodged
at York. Here he &ldquo;woke up to the interest of moral and
metaphysical speculations.&rdquo; Of his teachers, one, the Rev.
Charles Wellbeloved, was, Martineau said, &ldquo;a master of the true
Lardner type, candid and catholic, simple and thorough, humanly
fond indeed of the counsels of peace, but piously serving every
bidding of sacred truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;He never justified a prejudice; he
never misdirected our admiration; he never hurt an innocent
feeling or overbore a serious judgment; and he set up within us a
standard of Christian scholarship to which it must ever exalt us
to aspire.&rdquo;<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The other, the Rev. John Kenrick, he described as
a man so learned as to be placed by Dean Stanley &ldquo;in the same
line with Blomfield and Thirlwall,&rdquo;<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and as &ldquo;so far above the
level of either vanity or dogmatism, that cynicism itself could
not think of them in his presence.&rdquo;<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>On leaving the college in 1827 Martineau returned to Bristol
to teach in the school of Lant Carpenter; but in the following year
he was ordained for a Unitarian church in Dublin, whose senior
minister was a relative of his own. But his career there was in
1832 suddenly cut short by difficulties growing out of the
&ldquo;regium donum,&rdquo; which had on the death of the senior minister
fallen to him. He conceived it as &ldquo;a religious monopoly&rdquo; to
which &ldquo;the nation at large contributes,&rdquo; while &ldquo;Presbyterians
alone receive,&rdquo; and which placed him in &ldquo;a relation to the state&rdquo;
so &ldquo;seriously objectionable&rdquo; as to be &ldquo;impossible to hold.&rdquo;<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
The invidious distinction it drew between Presbyterians on the
one hand, and Catholics, Friends, free-thinking Christians, unbelievers
and Jews on the other, who were compelled to support a
ministry they &ldquo;conscientiously disapproved,&rdquo; offended his always
delicate conscience; while possibly the intellectual and ecclesiastical
atmosphere of the city proved uncongenial to his liberal
magnanimity. From Dublin he was called to Liverpool, and
there for a quarter of a century he exercised extraordinary
influence as a preacher, and achieved a high reputation as a
writer in religious philosophy. In 1840 he was appointed
professor of mental and moral philosophy and political economy
in Manchester New College, the seminary in which he had himself
been educated, and which had now removed from York to the
city after which it was named. This position he held for forty-five
years. In 1853 the college removed to London, and four
years later he followed it thither. In 1858 he was called to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page798" id="page798"></a>798</span>
occupy the pulpit of Little Portland Street chapel in London,
which he did at first for two years in conjunction with the Rev.
J. J. Tayler, who was also his colleague in the college, and then
for twelve years alone. In 1866 the chair of the philosophy of
mind and logic in University College, London, fell vacant, and
Martineau became a candidate. But potent opposition was
offered to the appointment of a minister of religion, and the
chair went to George Croom Robertson&mdash;then an untried man&mdash;between
whom and Martineau a cordial friendship came to exist.
In 1885 he retired, full of years and honours, from the principalship
of the college he had so long served and adorned.
Martineau, who was in his youth denied the benefit of a
university education, yet in his age found famous universities
eager to confer upon him their highest distinctions. He was
made LL.D. of Harvard in 1872, S.T.D. of Leiden in 1874,
D.D. of Edinburgh in 1884, D.C.L. of Oxford in 1888 and
D.Litt. of Dublin in 1891. He died in London on the 11th of
January 1900.</p>

<p>The life of Martineau was so essentially the life of the thinker,
and was so typical of the century in which he lived and the society
within which he moved, that he can be better understood through
his spoken mind than through his outward history. He was a
man happy in his ancestry; he inherited the dignity, the reserve,
the keen and vivid intellect, and the picturesque imagination of
the French Huguenot, though they came to him chastened and
purified by generations of Puritan discipline exercised under the
gravest ecclesiastical disabilities, and of culture maintained in
the face of exclusion from academic privileges. He had the
sweet and patient temper which knew how to live, unrepining
and unsoured, in the midst of the most watchful persecution,
public and private; and it is wonderful how rarely he used his
splendid rhetoric for the purposes of invective against the
spirit and policy from which he must have suffered deeply,
while, it may be added, he never hid an innuendo under a
metaphor or a trope. He was fundamentally too much a man
of strong convictions to be correctly described as open-minded,
for if nature ever determined any man&rsquo;s faith, it was his; the root
of his whole intellectual life, which was too deep to be disturbed
by any superficial change in his philosophy, being the feeling for
God. He has, indeed, described in graphic terms the greatest of
the more superficial changes he underwent; how he had &ldquo;carried
into logical and ethical problems the maxims and postulates of
physical knowledge,&rdquo; and had moved within the narrow lines
drawn by the philosophical instructions of the class-room
&ldquo;interpreting human phenomena by the analogy of external
nature&rdquo;; how he served in willing captivity &ldquo;the &lsquo;empirical&rsquo;
and &lsquo;necessarian&rsquo; mode of thought,&rdquo; even though &ldquo;shocked&rdquo;
by the dogmatism and acrid humours &ldquo;of certain distinguished
representatives&rdquo;;<a name="fa6j" id="fa6j" href="#ft6j"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and how in a period of &ldquo;second education&rdquo;
at Berlin, &ldquo;mainly under the admirable guidance of Professor
Trendelenburg,&rdquo; he experienced &ldquo;a new intellectual birth&rdquo; which
&ldquo;was essentially the gift of fresh conceptions, the unsealing of
hidden openings of self-consciousness, with unmeasured corridors
and sacred halls behind; and, once gained, was more or less available
throughout the history of philosophy, and lifted the darkness
from the pages of Kant and even Hegel.&rdquo;<a name="fa7j" id="fa7j" href="#ft7j"><span class="sp">7</span></a> But though this
momentous change of view illuminated his old beliefs and helped
him to re-interpret and re-articulate them, yet it made him no
more of a theist than he had been before. And as his theism
was, so was his religion and his philosophy. Certainly it was
true of him, in a far higher degree than of John Henry Newman,
that the being of God and himself were to his mind two absolutely
self-luminous truths&mdash;though both his God and his self
were almost infinitely remote from Newman&rsquo;s. And as these truths
were self-evident, so the religion he deduced from them was
sufficient, not only for his own moral and intellectual nature,
but also for man as he conceived him, for history as he knew it,
and for society as he saw it.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>We may, alternatively, describe Martineau&rsquo;s religion as his applied
philosophy or his philosophy as his explicated religion, and both as
the expression of his singularly fine ethical and reverent nature.
But to understand these in their mutual and explanatory relations
it will be necessary to exhibit the conditions under which his
thought grew into consistency and system. His main function
made him in his early life a preacher even more emphatically than
a teacher. In all he said and all he thought he had the preacher&rsquo;s
end in view. He was, indeed, no mere orator or speaker to multitudes.
He addressed a comparatively small and select circle,
a congregation of thoughtful and devout men, who cultivated
reverence and loved religion all the more that their own beliefs
were limited to the simplest and sublimest truths. He felt the
majesty of these truths to be the greater that they so represented
to him not only the most fundamental of human beliefs, but also all
that man could be reasonably expected to believe, though to believe
with his whole reason. Hence the beliefs he preached were never
to him mere speculative ideas, but rather the ultimate realities of
being and thought, the final truths as to the character and ways of
God interpreted into a law for the government of conscience and
the regulation of life. And so he became a positive religious teacher
by virtue of the very ideas that made the words of the Hebrew
prophets so potent and sublime. But he did more than interpret
to his age the significance of man&rsquo;s ultimate theistic beliefs, he gave
them vitality by reading them through the consciousness of Jesus
Christ. His religion was what he conceived the personal religion
of Jesus to have been; and He was to him more a person to be
imitated than an authority to be obeyed, rather an ideal to be
revered than a being to be worshipped.</p>

<p>Martineau&rsquo;s mental qualities fitted him to fulfil these high interpretative
functions. He had the imagination that invested with
personal being and ethical qualities the most abstruse notions. To
him space became a mode of divine activity, alive with the presence
and illuminated by the vision of God; time was an arena where the
divine hand guided and the divine will reigned. And though he did
not believe in the Incarnation, yet he held deity to be in a sense
manifest in humanity; its saints and heroes became, in spite of
innumerable frailties, after a sort divine; man underwent an
apotheosis, and all life was touched with the dignity and the grace
which it owed to its source. The 19th century had no more reverent
thinker than Martineau; the awe of the Eternal was the very
atmosphere that he breathed, and he looked at man with the
compassion of one whose thoughts were full of God.</p>

<p>To his function as a preacher we owe some of his most characteristic
and stimulating works, especially the discourses by which it
may be said he won his way to wide and influential recognition&mdash;<i>Endeavours
after the Christian Life</i>, 1st series, 1843; 2nd series, 1847;
<i>Hours of Thought</i>, 1st series, 1876; 2nd series, 1879; the various
hymn-books he issued at Dublin in 1831, at Liverpool in 1840, in
London in 1873; and the <i>Home Prayers</i> in 1891. But besides the
vocation he had freely selected and assiduously laboured to fulfil,
two more external influences helped to shape Martineau&rsquo;s mind and
define his problem and his work; the awakening of English thought
to the problems which underlie both philosophy and religion, and
the new and higher opportunities offered for their discussion in the
periodical press. The questions which lived in the earlier and more
formative period of his life concerned mainly the idea of the church,
the historical interpretation of the documents which described the
persons who had created the Christian religion, especially the person
and work of its founder; but those most alive in his later and
maturer time chiefly related to the philosophy of religion and ethics.
In one respect Martineau was singularly happy; he just escaped
the active and, on the whole, belittling period of the old Unitarian
controversy. When his ministry began its fires were slowly dying
down, though the embers still glowed. We feel its presence in his
earliest notable work, <i>The Rationale of Religious Enquiry</i>, 1836;
and may there see the rigour with which it applied audacious logic
to narrow premisses, the tenacity with which it clung to a limited
literal supernaturalism which it had no philosophy to justify, and
so could not believe without historical and verbal authority. This
traditional conservatism survived in the statement, which, while
it caused vehement discussion when the book appeared, was yet
not so much characteristic of the man as of the school in which he
had been trained, that &ldquo;in no intelligible sense can any one who
denies the supernatural origin of the religion of Christ be termed
a Christian,&rdquo; which term, he explained, was used not as &ldquo;a name
of praise,&rdquo; but simply as &ldquo;a designation of belief.&rdquo;<a name="fa8j" id="fa8j" href="#ft8j"><span class="sp">8</span></a> He censured
the German rationalists &ldquo;for having preferred, by convulsive
efforts of interpretation, to compress the memoirs of Christ and His
apostles into the dimensions of ordinary life, rather than admit the
operation of miracle on the one hand, or proclaim their abandonment
of Christianity on the other.&rdquo;<a name="fa9j" id="fa9j" href="#ft9j"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The echoes of the dying
controversy are thus distinct and not very distant in this book,
though it also offers in its larger outlook, in the author&rsquo;s evident
uneasiness under the burden of inherited beliefs, and his inability
to reconcile them with his new standpoint and accepted principles,
a curious forecast of his later development, while in its positive
premisses it presents a still more instructive contrast to the conclusions
of his later dialectic. Nor did the sound of the ancient
controversy ever cease to be audible to him. In 1839 he sprang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page799" id="page799"></a>799</span>
to the defence of Unitarian doctrine, which had been assailed by
certain Liverpool clergymen, of whom Fielding Ould was the most
active and Hugh McNeill the most famous. As his share in the
controversy, Martineau published five discourses, in which he
discussed &ldquo;the Bible as the great autobiography of human nature
from its infancy to its perfection,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Deity of Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vicarious
Redemption,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christianity without Priest and
without Ritual.&rdquo;<a name="fa10j" id="fa10j" href="#ft10j"><span class="sp">10</span></a> He remained to the end a keen and vigilant
apologist of the school in which he had been nursed. But the
questions proper to the new day came swiftly upon his quick and
susceptible mind&mdash;enlarged, deepened and developed it. Within
his own fold new light was breaking. To W. E. Channing (<i>q.v.</i>),
whom Martineau had called &ldquo;the inspirer of his youth,&rdquo; Theodore
Parker had succeeded, introducing more radical ideas as to religion
and a more drastic criticism of sacred history. Blanco White, &ldquo;the
rationalist A&rsquo;Kempis,&rdquo; who had dared to appear as &ldquo;a religious
sceptic in God&rsquo;s presence,&rdquo; had found a biographer and interpreter
in Martineau&rsquo;s friend and colleague, John Hamilton Thom. Within
the English Church men with whom he had both personal and
religious sympathy rose&mdash;Whately, of whom he said, &ldquo;We know
no living writer who has proved so little and disproved so much&rdquo;;<a name="fa11j" id="fa11j" href="#ft11j"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
and Thomas Arnold, &ldquo;a man who could be a hero without romance&rdquo;;<a name="fa12j" id="fa12j" href="#ft12j"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
F. D. Maurice, whose character, marked by &ldquo;religious realism,&rdquo;
sought in the past &ldquo;the witness to eternal truths, the manifestation
by time-samples of infinite realities and unchanging relations&rdquo;;<a name="fa13j" id="fa13j" href="#ft13j"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
and Charles Kingsley, &ldquo;a great teacher,&rdquo; though one &ldquo;certain to
go astray the moment he becomes didactic.&rdquo;<a name="fa14j" id="fa14j" href="#ft14j"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Beside these may
be placed men like E. B. Pusey and J. H. Newman, whose mind
Martineau said was &ldquo;critical, not prophetic, since without immediateness
of religious vision,&rdquo; and whose faith is &ldquo;an escape from an
alternative scepticism, which receives the <i>veto</i> not of his reason but
of his will,&rdquo;<a name="fa15j" id="fa15j" href="#ft15j"><span class="sp">15</span></a> as men for whose teachings and methods he had a
potent and stimulating antipathy. The philosophic principles and
religious deductions of Dean Mansel he disliked as much as those of
Newman, but he respected his arguments more. Apart from the
Churches, men like Carlyle and Matthew Arnold&mdash;with whom he
had much in common&mdash;influenced him; while Herbert Spencer in
England and Comte in France afforded the antithesis needful to
the dialectical development of his own views. He came to know
German philosophy and criticism, especially the criticism of Baur
and the Tübingen school, which affected profoundly his construction
of Christian history. And these were strengthened by French
influences, notably those of Renan and the Strassburg theologians.
The rise of evolution, and the new scientific way of looking at nature
and her creative methods, compelled him to rethink and reformulate
his theistic principles and conclusions, especially as to the forms
under which the relation of God to the world and His action within
it could be conceived. Under the impulses which came from these
various sides Martineau&rsquo;s mind lived and moved, and as they
successively rose he promptly, by appreciation or criticism, responded
to the dialectical issues which they raised.</p>

<p>In the discussion of these questions the periodical press supplied
him with the opportunity of taking an effective part. At first his
literary activity was limited to sectional publications, and he addressed
his public, now as editor and now as leading contributor,
in the <i>Monthly Repository</i>, the <i>Christian Reformer</i>, the <i>Prospective</i>,
the Westminster and the <i>National Review</i>. Later, especially when
scientific speculation had made the theistic problem urgent, he was a
frequent contributor to the literary monthlies. And when in 1890
he began to gather together the miscellaneous essays and papers
written during a period of sixty years, he expressed the hope that,
though &ldquo;they could lay no claim to logical consistency,&rdquo; they might
yet show &ldquo;beneath the varying complexion of their thought some
intelligible moral continuity,&rdquo; &ldquo;leading in the end to a view of life
more coherent and less defective than was presented at the beginning.&rdquo;<a name="fa16j" id="fa16j" href="#ft16j"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
And though it is a proud as well as a modest hope, no one
could call it unjustified. For his essays are fine examples of permanent
literature appearing in an ephemeral medium, and represent
work which has solid worth for later thought as well as for the speculation
of their own time. There is hardly a name or a movement
in the religious history of the century which he did not touch and
illuminate. It was in this form that he criticized the &ldquo;atheistic
mesmerism&rdquo; to which his sister Harriet had committed herself,
and she never forgave his criticism. But his course was always
singularly independent, and, though one of the most affectionate
and most sensitive of men, yet it was his fortune to be so fastidious
in thought and so conscientious in judgment as often to give
offence or create alarm in those he deeply respected or tenderly
loved.</p>

<p>The theological and philosophical discussions which thus appeared
he later described as &ldquo;the tentatives which gradually prepared
the way for the more systematic expositions of the <i>Types of Ethical
Theory</i> and <i>The Study of Religion</i>, and, in some measure, of <i>The
Seat of Authority in Religion</i>.&rdquo;<a name="fa17j" id="fa17j" href="#ft17j"><span class="sp">17</span></a> These books expressed his mature
thought, and may be said to contain, in what he conceived as a final
form, the speculative achievements of his life. They appeared respectively
in 1885, 1888 and 1890, and were without doubt remarkable
feats to be performed by a man who had passed his eightieth year.
Their literary and speculative qualities are indeed exceptionally
brilliant; they are splendid in diction, elaborate in argument, cogent
yet reverent, keen while fearless in criticism. But they have also
most obvious defects: they are unquestionably the books of an old
man who had thought much as well as spoken and written often on
the themes he discusses, yet who had finally put his material together
in haste at a time when his mind had lost, if not its dialectic vigour,
yet its freshness and its sense of proportion; and who had been so
accustomed to amplify the single stages of his argument that he had
forgotten how much they needed to be reduced to scale and to be
built into an organic whole. In the first of these books his nomenclature
is unfortunate; his division of ethical theories into the
&ldquo;unpsychological,&rdquo; &ldquo;idiopsychological,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;hetero-psychological,&rdquo;
is incapable of historical justification; his exposition of
single ethical systems is, though always interesting and suggestive,
often arbitrary and inadequate, being governed by dialectical
exigencies rather than historical order and perspective. In the
second of the above books his idea of religion is somewhat of an
anachronism; as he himself confessed, he &ldquo;used the word in the
sense which it invariably bore half a century ago,&rdquo; as denoting
&ldquo;belief in an ever-living God, a divine mind and will ruling the
universe and holding moral relations with mankind.&rdquo; As thus
used, it was a term which governed the problems of speculative
theism rather than those connected with the historical origin,
the evolution and the organization of religion. And these are the
questions which are now to the front. These criticisms mean that
his most elaborate discussions came forty years too late, for they were
concerned with problems which agitated the middle rather than the
end of the 19th century. But if we pass from this criticism of form
to the actual contents of the two books, we are bound to confess
that they constitute a wonderfully cogent and persuasive theistic
argument. That argument may be described as a criticism of man
and his world used as a basis for the construction of a reasoned idea
of nature and being. Man and nature, thought and being, fitted
each other. What was implicit in nature had become explicit in
man; the problem of the individual was one with the problem of
universal experience. The interpretation of man was therefore
the interpretation of his universe. Emphasis was made to fall on
the reason, the conscience and the will of the finite personality;
and just as these were found to be native in him they were held to be
immanent in the cause of his universe. What lived in time belonged
to eternity; the microcosm was the epitome of the macrocosm;
the reason which reigned in man interpreted the law that was
revealed in conscience and the power which governed human destiny,
while the freedom which man realized was the direct negation both
of necessity and of the operation of any fortuitous cause in the
cosmos.</p>

<p>It was not possible, however, that the theistic idea could be discussed
in relation to nature only. It was necessary that it should
be applied to history and to the forces and personalities active within
it. And of these the greatest was of course the Person that had
created the Christian religion. What did Jesus signify? What
authority belonged to Him and to the books that contain His
history and interpret His person? This was the problem which
Martineau attempted to deal with in <i>The Seat of Authority in Religion</i>.
The workmanship of the book is unequal: historical and literary
criticism had never been Martineau&rsquo;s strongest point, although he
had almost continuously maintained an amount of New Testament
study, as his note-books show. In its speculative parts the book is
quite equal to those that had gone before, but in its literary and
historical parts there are indications of a mind in which a long-practised
logic had become a rooted habit. While a comparison
of his expositions of the Pauline and Johannine Christologies with
the earlier Unitarian exegesis in which he had been trained shows
how wide is the interval, the work does not represent a mind that had
throughout its history lived and worked in the delicate and judicial
investigations he here tried to conduct.</p>
</div>

<p>Martineau&rsquo;s theory of the religious society or church was
that of an idealist rather than of a statesman or practical politician.
He stood equally remote from the old Voluntary principle,
that &ldquo;the State had nothing to do with religion,&rdquo; and from the
sacerdotal position that the clergy stood in an apostolic succession,
and either constituted the Church or were the persons
into whose hands its guidance had been committed. He hated
two things intensely, a sacrosanct priesthood and an enforced
uniformity. He may be said to have believed in the sanity and
sanctity of the state rather than of the Church. Statesmen
he could trust as he would not trust ecclesiastics. And so he
even propounded a scheme, which fell still-born, that would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page800" id="page800"></a>800</span>
repealed uniformity, taken the church out of the hands of a
clerical order, and allowed the coordination of sects or churches
under the state. Not that he would have allowed the state to
touch doctrine, to determine polity or discipline; but he would
have had it to recognize historical achievement, religious character
and capacity, and endow out of its ample resources those
societies which had vindicated their right to be regarded as
making for religion. His ideal may have been academic, but
it was the dream of a mind that thought nobly both of religion
and of the state.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINET,<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> a military term (more generally used in a
disparaging than in a complimentary sense) implying a strict
disciplinarian or drill-master. The term originated in the French
army about the middle of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s reign, and was derived
from Jean Martinet (d. 1672), who as lieutenant-colonel of the
King&rsquo;s regiment of foot and inspector-general of infantry drilled
and trained that arm in the model regular army created by Louis
and Louvois between 1660 and 1670. Martinet seems also to have
introduced the copper pontoons with which Louis bridged the
Rhine in 1672. He was killed, as a <i>maréchal de camp</i>, at the
siege of Duisburg in the same year, being accidentally shot by
bis own artillery while leading the infantry assault. His death,
and that of the Swiss captain Soury by the same discharge gave
rise to a <i>bon mot</i>, typical of the polite ingratitude of the age,
that Duisburg had only cost the king a martin and a mouse.
The &ldquo;martin&rdquo; as a matter of fact shares with Vauban and other
professional soldiers of Louis XIV. the glory of having made the
French army the first and best regular army in Europe. Great
nobles, such as Turenne, Condé and Luxemburg, led this army
and inspired it, but their fame has obscured that of the men who
made it manageable and efficient. It was about this time that
the soldier of fortune, who joined a regiment with his own arms
and equipment and had learned his trade by varied experience,
began to give place to the soldier regularly enlisted as a recruit in
permanent regiments and trained by his own officers. The
consequence of this was the introduction of a uniform, or nearly
uniform system of drill and training, which in all essentials has
endured to the present day. Thus Martinet was the forerunner
of Leopold of Dessau and Frederick William, just as Jean
Jacques de Fourilles, the organizer of the cavalry, who was
forced into an untimely charge at Seneffe (1674) by a brutal
taunt of Condé, and there met his death, was the forerunner
of Zieten and Seydlitz. These men, while differing from the
creators of the Prussian army in that they contributed nothing
to the tactics of their arms, at least made tactics possible by the
thorough drilling and organization they imparted to the formerly
heterogeneous and hardly coherent elements of an army.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTÍNEZ DE LA ROSA, FRANCISCO DE PAULA<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (1789-1862),
Spanish statesman and dramatist, was born on the 10th
of March 1789 at Granada, and educated at the university there.
He won popularity with a series of epigrams on local celebrities
published under the title of <i>El Cementerio de momo</i>. During
the struggle against Napoleon he took the patriotic side, was
elected deputy, and at Cadiz produced his first play, <i>Lo que puede
un empleo</i>, a prose comedy in the manner of the younger Moratin.
<i>La Viuda de Padilla</i> (1814), a tragedy modelled upon Alfieri, was
less acceptable to the Spanish public. Meanwhile the author
became more and more engulfed in politics, and in 1814 was
banished to Africa, where he remained till 1820, when he was
suddenly recalled and appointed prime minister. During the
next three years he was the most unpopular man in Spain;
denounced as a revolutionist by the Conservatives and as a
reactionary by the Liberals, he alienated the sympathies of all
parties, and his rhetoric earned for him the contemptuous nickname
of <i>Rosita la Pastelera</i>. Exiled in 1823, he took refuge in
Paris, where he issued his <i>Obras literarias</i> (1827), including his
<i>Arte poética</i>, in which he exaggerated the literary theories
already promulgated by Luzán. Returning to Spain in 1831,
he became prime minister on the death of Ferdinand VII., but
proved incapable of coping with the insurrectionary movement
and resigned in 1834. He was ambassador at Paris in 1839-1840
and at Rome in 1842-1843, joined the Conservative party, held
many important offices, and was president of congress and
director of the Spanish academy at the time of his death, which
took place at Madrid on the 7th of February 1862. As a statesman,
Martínez de la Rosa never rose above mediocrity. It was
his misfortune to be in place without real power, to struggle
against a turbulent pseudo-democratic movement promoted by
unscrupulous soldiers, and to contend with the intrigues of the
king, the court camarilla and the clergy. But circumstances
which hampered him in politics favoured his career in literature.
He was not a great natural force; his early plays and poems are
influenced by Moratin or by Meléndez Valdés; his <i>Espirítu del
siglo</i> (1835) is an elegant summary of all the commonplaces concerning
the philosophy of history; his <i>Doña Isabel de Solís</i> (1837-1846)
is a weak imitation of Walter Scott&rsquo;s historical novels.
Still his place in the history of Spanish literature is secure, if not
eminent. Through the happy accident of his exile at Paris he
was thrown into relations with the leaders of the French romantic
movement, and was so far impressed with the innovations of the
new school as to write in French a romantic piece entitled <i>Aben-Humeya</i>
(1830), which was played at the Porte Saint-Martin.
The experiment was not unsuccessful, and on his return to Madrid
Martínez de la Rosa produced <i>La Conjuratión de Venecia</i>
(April 23, 1834), which entitles him to be called the pioneer of the
romantic drama in Spain. The play is more reminiscent of
Casimir Delavigne than of Victor Hugo; but it was unquestionably
effective, and smoothed the way for the bolder essays of
Rivas, Garcia Gutiérrez and Hartzenbusch.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (1706-1784), Italian musician,
was born at Bologna on the 24th of April 1706. His father,
Antonio Maria Martini, a violinist, taught him the elements
of music and the violin; later he learned singing and harpsichord
playing from Padre Pradieri, and counterpoint from Antonio
Riccieri. Having received his education in classics from
the fathers of the oratory of San Filippo Neri, he afterwards
entered upon a noviciate at the Franciscan monastery at Lago,
at the close of which he was received as a Minorite on the 11th of
September 1722. In 1725, though only nineteen years old, he
received the appointment of chapel-master in the Franciscan
church at Bologna, where his compositions attracted attention.
At the invitation of amateurs and professional friends he opened
a school of composition at which several celebrated musicians
were trained; as a teacher he consistently declared his preference
for the traditions of the old Roman school of composition.
Padre Martini was a zealous collector of musical literature, and
possessed an extensive musical library. Burney estimated it at
17,000 volumes; after Martini&rsquo;s death a portion of it passed
to the Imperial library at Vienna, the rest remaining in Bologna,
now in the Liceo Rossini. Most contemporary musicians speak
of Martini with admiration, and Mozart&rsquo;s father consulted him
with regard to the talents of his son. Abt Vogler, however,
makes reservations in his praise, condemning his philosophical
principles as too much in sympathy with those of Fox, which
had already been expressed by P. Vallotti. He died at Bologna
on the 4th of August 1784. His <i>Elogio</i> was published by Pietro
della Valle at Bologna in the same year.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The greater number of Martini&rsquo;s sacred compositions remain
unprinted. The Liceo of Bologna possesses the MSS. of two oratorios;
and a requiem, with some other pieces of church music, are
now in Vienna. <i>Litaniae atque antiphonae finales B. V. Mariae</i> were
published at Bologna in 1734, as also twelve <i>Sonate d&rsquo;intavolatura</i>;
six <i>Sonate per l&rsquo;organo ed il cembalo</i> in 1747; and <i>Duetti da camera</i>
in 1763. Martini&rsquo;s most important works are his <i>Storia della musica</i>
(Bologna, 1757-1781) and his <i>Saggio di contrapunto</i> (Bologna,
1774-1775). The former, of which the three published volumes
relate wholly to ancient music, and thus represent a mere fragment
of the author&rsquo;s vast plan, exhibits immense reading and industry,
but is written in a dry and unattractive style, and is overloaded with
matter which cannot be regarded as historical. At the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page801" id="page801"></a>801</span>
and end of each chapter occur puzzle-canons, wherein the primary
part or parts alone are given, and the reader has to discover the
canon that fixes the period and the interval at which the response
is to enter. Some of these are exceedingly difficult, but Cherubini
solved the whole of them. The <i>Saggio</i> is a learned and valuable
work, containing an important collection of examples from the best
masters of the old Italian and Spanish schools, with excellent
explanatory notes. It treats chiefly of the tonalities of the plain
chant, and of counterpoints constructed upon them. Besides being
the author of several controversial works, Martini drew up a <i>Dictionary
of Ancient Musical Terms</i>, which appeared in the second volume
of G. B. Doni&rsquo;s <i>Works</i>; he also published a treatise on <i>The Theory
of Numbers as applied to Music</i>. His celebrated canons, published
in London, about 1800, edited by Pio Cianchettini, show him to have
had a strong sense of musical humour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINI, SIMONE<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1283-1344), Sienese painter, called also
Simone di Martino, and more commonly, but not correctly,
Simon Memmi,<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was born in 1283. He followed the manner
of painting proper to his native Siena, as improved by Duccio,
which is essentially different from the style of Giotto and his
school, and the idea that Simone was himself a pupil of Giotto
is therefore wide of the mark. The Sienese style is less natural,
dignified and reserved than the Florentine; it has less unity of
impression, has more tendency to pietism, and is marked by
exaggerations which are partly related to the obsolescent
Byzantine manner, and partly seem to forebode certain peculiarities
of the fully developed art which we find prevalent in
Michelangelo. Simone, in especial, tended to an excessive and
rather affected tenderness in his female figures; he was more
successful in single figures and in portraits than in large compositions
of incident. He finished with scrupulous minuteness,
and was elaborate in decorations of patterning, gilding, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The first known fresco of Simone is the vast one which he
executed in the hall of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena&mdash;the
&ldquo;Madonna Enthroned, with the Infant,&rdquo; and a number of angels
and saints; its date is 1315, at which period he was already an
artist of repute throughout Italy. In S. Lorenzo Maggiore of
Naples he painted a life-sized picture of King Robert crowned
by his brother Lewis, bishop of Toulouse; this also is extant,
but much damaged. In 1320 he painted for the high altar of
the church of S. Caterina in Pisa the Virgin and Child between
six saints; above are archangels, apostles and other figures.
The compartmented portions of this work are now dispersed,
some of them being in the academy of Siena. Towards 1321
he executed for the church of S. Domenico in Orvieto a picture
of the bishop of Savona kneeling before the Madonna attended
by saints, now in the Fabriceria of the cathedral. Certain
frescoes in Assisi in the chapel of San Martino, representing the
life of that saint, ascribed by Vasari to Puccio Capanna, are
now, upon internal evidence, assigned to Simone. He painted
also, in the south transept of the lower church of the same
edifice, figures of the Virgin and eight saints. In 1328 he
produced for the sala del consilio in Siena a striking equestrian
portrait of the victorious general Guidoriccio Fogliani
de&rsquo; Ricci.</p>

<p>Simone had married in 1324 Giovanna, the daughter of
Memmo (Guglielmo) di Filippuccio. Her brother, named Lippo
Memmi, was also a painter, and was frequently associated with
Simone in his work; and this is the only reason why Simone
has come down to us with the family-name Memmi. They
painted together in 1333 the &ldquo;Annunciation&rdquo; which is now in
the Uffizi gallery. Simone kept a bottega (or shop), undertaking
any ornamental work, and his gains were large. In 1339 he
settled at the papal court in Avignon, where he made the
acquaintance of Petrarch and Laura; and he painted for the
poet a portrait of his lady, which gave occasion for two of
Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets, in which Simone is eulogized. He also
illuminated for the poet a copy of the commentary of Servius
upon Virgil, now preserved in the Ambrosian library of Milan.
He was largely employed in the decorations of the papal buildings
in Avignon, and several of his works still remain&mdash;in the cathedral,
in the hall of the consistory, and, in the two chapels of
the palace, the stories of the Baptist, and of Stephen and other
saints. One of his latest productions (1342) is the picture of
&ldquo;Christ Found by his Parents in the Temple,&rdquo; now in the
Liverpool Gallery. Simone died in Avignon in July 1344.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Some of the works with which Simone&rsquo;s name and fame have been
generally identified are not now regarded as his. Such are the compositions,
in the Campo Santo of Pisa, from the legend of S. Ranieri,
and the &ldquo;Assumption of the Virgin&rdquo;; and the great frescoes in the
Cappellone degli Spagnuoli, in S. Maria Novella, Florence, representing
the Triumph of Religion through the work of the Dominican
order, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINIQUE,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> an island of the West Indies, belonging to
the chain of the Lesser Antilles, and constituting a French
colony, between the British islands of Dominica and St Lucia,
25 m. S. of the one and 20 m. N. of the other, about 14° 40&prime; N.,
61° W. Its length is 40 m., its greatest width 21 m.; and the area
comprises 380 sq. m. A cluster of volcanic mountains in the
north, a similar group in the south, and a line of lower heights
between them, form the backbone of the island. Its deep
ravines and precipitous escarpments are reduced in appearance
to gentle undulations by the drapery of the forests. The massif
of Mont Pelé in the north is the culminating point of the island
(4430 ft.); that of Carbet is little inferior (3963 ft.), but the
mountains in the south are much lower. Mont Pelé is notorious
for an appalling eruption in May 1902.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of the numerous streams which traverse the few miles of country
between the watershed and the sea (the longest radiating from Mount
Carbet), about seventy-five are of considerable size, and in the rainy
season become deep and often destructive torrents. On the north-west
and north the coast is elevated and bold; and similarly on the
south, where a lateral range, branching from the backbone of the
island, forms a blunt peninsula bounding the low-shored western
bay of Fort de France on the south. Another peninsula, called
Caravelle, projects from the middle part of the east coast, and south
of this the coast is low and fretted, with many islets and cays lying
off it. Coral reefs occur especially in this locality. Plains, most
numerous and extensive in the south, occupy about one-third of the
total area of the island.</p>

<p>The mean annual temperature is 80° F. in the coast region,
the monthly mean for June being 83°, and that for January 77°.
Of the annual rainfall of 87 in., August has the heaviest share
(11.3 in.), though the rainy season extends from June to October;
March, the driest month, has 3.7. Martinique enjoys a marked
immunity from hurricanes. The low coastal districts are not very
healthy for Europeans in the hotter months, but there are numerous
sanatoria in the forest region at an elevation of about 1500 ft.,
where the average temperature is some 10° F. lower than that
already quoted. The north winds which prevail from November to
February are comparatively fresh and dry; those from the south
(July to October) are damp and warm. From March to June easterly
winds are prevalent.</p>
</div>

<p>The population increased from 162,861 in 1878 to 175,863 in
1888 and 203,781 in 1901. In 1902 the great eruption of Mont
Pelé occurred, and in 1905 the population was only 182,024.
The bulk of the population consists of Creole negroes and half-castes
of various grades, ranging from the &ldquo;Saccatra,&rdquo; who has
retained hardly any trace of Caucasian blood, to the so-called
&ldquo;Sangmêlé,&rdquo; with only a suspicion of negro commixture. The
capital of the island is Fort de France, on the west-coast bay of
the same name, with a fine harbour defended by three forts, and
a population of 18,000. The other principal centres of population
are, on the west coast Lamentin, on the same bay as the
capital, and on the east coast Le François and Le Robert. The
colony is administered by a governor and a general council, and
returns a senator and two deputies. There are elective municipal
councils. The chief product is sugar, and some coffee, cocoa,
tobacco and cotton are grown. The island is served by British,
French and American steamship lines, and local communications
are carried on by small coasting steamers and by subsidized
mail coaches, as there are excellent roads. In 1905 the total
value of the exports, consisting mainly of sugar, rum and cocoa,
was £725,460, France taking by far the greater part, while
imports were valued at £596,294, of which rather more than
one-half by value came from France, the United States of
America being the next principal importing country. In 1903,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page802" id="page802"></a>802</span>
the year following the eruption of Mont Pelé, exports were
valued at £604,163.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:519px; height:580px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img802.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Martinique, the name of which may be derived from a native
form Madiana or Mantinino, was probably discovered by Columbus
on the 15th of June 1502; although by some authorities
its discovery is placed in 1493. It was at that time inhabited
by Caribs who had expelled or incorporated an older stock.
It was not until the 25th of June 1635 that possession was taken
of the island in the name of the French <i>Compagnie des Îles
d&rsquo;Amérique</i>. Actual settlement was carried out in the same
year by Pierre Belain, Sieur d&rsquo;Esnambuc, captain-general of
the island of St Christopher. In 1637 his nephew Dyel Duparquet
(d. 1658) became captain-general of the colony, now
numbering seven hundred men, and subsequently obtained the
seigneurie of the island by purchase from the company under
the authority of the king of France. In 1654 welcome was
given to three hundred Jews expelled from Brazil, and by 1658
there were at least five thousand people exclusive of the Caribs,
who were soon after exterminated. Purchased by the French
government from Duparquet&rsquo;s children for 120,000 livres,
Martinique was assigned to the West India Company, but in
1674 it became part of the royal domain. The <i>habitants</i> (French
landholders) at first devoted themselves to the cultivation of
cotton and tobacco; but in 1650 sugar plantations were begun,
and in 1723 the coffee plant was introduced. Slave labour
having been introduced at an early period of the occupation,
there were 60,000 blacks in the island by 1736. This slavery
was abolished in 1860. Martinique had a full share of wars.
In early days the Caribs were not brought under subjection
without severe struggles. In 1666 and 1667 the island was
attacked by the British without success, and hostilities were
terminated by the treaty of Breda. The Dutch made similar
attempts in 1674, and the British again attacked the island in
1693. Captured by Rodney in 1762, Martinique was next year
restored to the French; but after the conquest by Sir John
Jervis and Sir Charles Grey in 1793 it was retained for eight
years; and, seized again in 1809, it was not surrendered till 1814.
The island was the birth-place of the Empress Josephine.</p>

<p>Martinique has suffered from occasional severe storms, as in
1767, when 1600 persons perished, and M. de la Pagerie, father
of the Empress Josephine, was practically ruined, and in 1839,
1891 and 1903, when much damage was done to the sugar crop.
Earthquakes have also been frequent, but the most terrible
natural disaster was the eruption of Mont Pelé in 1902, by which
the town of St Pierre, formerly the chief commercial centre of
the island, was destroyed. During the earlier months of the
year various manifestations of volcanic activity had occurred;
on the 25th of April there was a heavy fall of ashes, and on the
2nd and 3rd of May a heavy eruption destroyed extensive sugar
plantations north of St Pierre, and caused a loss of some 150
lives. A few days later the news that the Souffrière in St Vincent
was in eruption reassured the inhabitants of St Pierre, as it was
supposed that this outbreak might relieve the volcano of Pelé.
But on the 8th of May the final catastrophe came without
warning; a mass of fire, compared to a flaming whirlwind, swept
over St Pierre, destroying the ships in the harbour, among which,
however, one, the &ldquo;Roddam&rdquo; of Scrutton, escaped. A fall
of molten lava and ashes followed the flames, accompanied by
dense gases which asphyxiated those who had thus far escaped.
The total loss of life was estimated at 40,000. Consternation
was caused not only in the West Indies, but in France and
throughout the world, and at first it was seriously suggested
that the island should be evacuated, but no countenance was
lent to this proposal by the French government. Relief
measures were undertaken and voluntary subscriptions raised.
The material losses were estimated at £4,000,000; but, besides
St Pierre, only one-tenth of the island had been devastated,
and although during July there was further volcanic activity,
causing more destruction, the economic situation recovered more
rapidly than was expected.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINS FERRY,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> a city of Belmont county, Ohio, U.S.A.,
on the Ohio River, nearly opposite Wheeling, West Virginia.
Pop. (1890), 6250; (1900), 7760, including 1033 foreign-born
and 252 negroes; (1910), 9133. It is served by the Pennsylvania
(Cleveland &amp; Pittsburg Division), the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and the
Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie (Wabash System) railways, and by several
steamboat lines. The city is situated on two plateaus; the
lower is occupied chiefly by factories, the upper by dwellings.
Coal mining and manufacturing are the principal industries;
among factory products are iron, steel, tin, stoves, machinery
and glassware. The municipality owns and operates the waterworks
and an electric-lighting plant. A settlement was attempted
here in 1785, but was abandoned on account of trouble with
the Indians. In 1795 a town was laid out by Absalom Martin
and was called Jefferson, but this, too, was abandoned, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page803" id="page803"></a>803</span>
account of its not being made the county-seat. The town was
laid out again in 1835 by Ebenezer Martin (son of Absalom
Martin) and was called Martinsville; the present name was
substituted a few years later. The Martins and other pioneers
are buried in Walnut Grove Cemetery within the city limits.
Martins Ferry was incorporated as a town in 1865 and chartered
as a city in 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTINUZZI, GEORGE<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> [<span class="sc">György Utie&#353;enovi&#263;</span>] (1482-1551),
Hungarian statesman, who, since he usually signed himself
&ldquo;Frater Georgius,&rdquo; is known in Hungarian history as <span class="sc">Frater
György</span> or simply <span class="sc">The Frater</span>, was born at Kami&#269;ic in Croatia,
the son of Gregory Utie&#353;enovi&#263;, a Croatian gentleman. His
mother was a Martinuzzi, a Venetian patrician family. From
his eighth to his twentieth year he was attached to the court
of John Corvinus; subsequently, entering the service of the
Zapolya family, he saw something of warfare under John Zapolya
but, tiring of a military life, he entered the Paulician Order in
his twenty-eighth year. His historical career began when his
old patron Zapolya, now king of Hungary, forced to fly before
his successful rival Ferdinand, afterwards the emperor Ferdinand
I., sent him on a diplomatic mission to Hungary. It was
due to his tact and ability that John recovered Buda (1529),
and henceforth Frater György became his treasurer and chief
counsellor. In 1534 he became bishop of Grosswardein; in 1538
he concluded with Austria the peace of Grosswardein, whereby
the royal title and the greater part of Hungary were conceded
to Zapolya. King John left the Frater the guardian of his
infant son John Sigismund, who was proclaimed and crowned
king of Hungary, the Frater acting as regent. He frustrated
all the attempts of the queen mother, Isabella, to bring in the
Austrians, and when, in 1541, an Austrian army appeared
beneath the walls of Buda, he arrested the queen and applied
to the Porte for help. On the 28th of August 1541, the Frater
did homage to the sultan, but during his absence with the baby
king in the Turkish camp, the grand vizier took Buda by subtlety.
Then only the Frater recognized the necessity of a composition
with both Austria and Turkey. He attained it by the treaty
of Gyula (Dec. 29, 1541), whereby western Hungary fell to
Ferdinand, while Transylvania, as an independent principality
under Turkish suzerainty, reverted to John Sigismund. It
included, besides Transylvania proper, many Hungarian counties
on both sides of the Theiss, and the important city of Kassa.
It was the Frater&rsquo;s policy to preserve Transylvania neutral and
intact by cultivating amicable relations with Austria without
offending the Porte. It was a difficult policy, but succeeded
brilliantly for a time. In 1545, encouraged by the growing
unpopularity of Ferdinand, owing to his incapacity to defend
Hungary against the Turks, the Frater was tempted to unite
Austrian Hungary to Transylvania and procure the election of
John Sigismund as the national king. But recognizing that this
was impossible, he aimed at an alliance with Ferdinand on
terms of relative equality, and to this system he adhered till his
death. Queen Isabella, who hated the Frater and constantly
opposed him, complained of him to the sultan, who commanded
that either the traitor himself or his head should be sent to
Constantinople (1550). A combination was then formed against
him of the queen, the hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia and
the Turks; but the Frater shut the queen up in Gyula-Fehérvár,
drove the hospodars out of Transylvania, defeated the Turks at
Déva, and finally compelled Isabella to accept a composition
with Austria very profitable to her family and to Transylvania,
at the same time soothing the rage of the sultan by flatteries and
gifts. This compact, a masterpiece of statesmanship, was confirmed
by the diet of Kolozsvár in August 1551. The Frater
retained the governorship of Transylvania, and was subsequently
consecrated archbishop of Esztergom and received the red hat.
Thus Hungary was once more reunited, but the inability of
Ferdinand to defend it against the Turks, as promised, forced
the Frater, for the common safety, to resume the payment of
tribute to the Porte in December 1551. Unfortunately, the
Turks no longer trusted a diplomatist they could not understand,
while Ferdinand suspected him of an intention to secure Hungary
for himself. When the Turks (in 1551) took Csanád and other
places, the Frater and the imperial generals Castaldo and
Pallavicini combined their forces against the common foe; but
when the Frater privately endeavoured to mediate between the
Turks and the Hungarians, Castaldo represented him to Ferdinand
as a traitor, and asked permission to kill him if necessary. The
Frater&rsquo;s secretary Marco Aurelio Ferrari was hired, and stabbed
his master from behind at the castle of Alvinczy while reading
a letter, on the 18th of December 1551; but the cardinal, though
in his sixty-ninth year, fought for his life, and was only
despatched with the aid of Pallavicini and a band of bravos.
Ferdinand took the responsibility of the murder on himself.
He sent to Julius III. an accusation of treason against the Frater
in eighty-seven articles, and after long hesitation, and
hearing one hundred and sixteen witnesses, the pope exonerated
Ferdinand of blame.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTIUS, CARL FRIEDRICH PHILIPP VON<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1794-1868),
German botanist and traveller, was born on the 17th of April
1794 at Erlangen, where he graduated M.D. in 1814, publishing
as his thesis a critical catalogue of plants in the botanic garden
of the university. He afterwards devoted himself to botanical
study, and in 1817 he and J. B. von Spix were sent to Brazil
by the king of Bavaria. They travelled from Rio de Janeiro
through several of the southern and eastern provinces of Brazil,
and ascended the river Amazon to Tabatinga, as well as some of
its larger affluents. On his return to Europe in 1820 he was
appointed conservator of the botanic garden at Munich, and in
1826 professor of botany in the university there, and held both
offices till 1864. He devoted his chief attention to the flora of
Brazil, and in addition to numerous short papers he published
the <i>Nova Genera et Species Plantarum Brasiliensium</i> (1823-1832,
3 vols.) and <i>Icones selectae Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Brasiliensium</i>
(1827), both works being finely illustrated. An account
of his travels in Brazil appeared in 3 vols. 4to, 1823-1831, with
an atlas of plates, but probably the work by which he is best
known is his <i>Historia Palmarum</i> (1823-1850) in 3 large folio
volumes, of which one describes the palms discovered by himself
in Brazil. In 1840 he began the <i>Flora Brasiliensis</i>, with the
assistance of the most distinguished European botanists, who
undertook monographs of the various orders. Its publication
was continued after his death under the editorship of A. W.
Eichler (1839-1887) until 1887, and subsequently of Ignaz von
Urban. He also edited several works on the zoological collections
made in Brazil by Spix, after the death of the latter in
1826. On the outbreak of potato disease in Europe he investigated
it and published his observations in 1842. He also
published works and short papers on the aborigines of Brazil,
on their civil and social condition, on their past and probable
future, on their diseases and medicines, and on the languages
of the various tribes, especially the Tupi. He died at Munich
on the 13th of December 1868.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTOS, CHRISTINO<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (1830-1893), Spanish politician, was
born at Granada on the 13th of September 1830. He was
educated there and at Madrid University, where his Radicalism
soon got him into trouble, and he narrowly escaped being
expelled for his share in student riots and other demonstrations
against the governments of Queen Isabella. He distinguished
himself as a journalist on <i>El Tribuno</i>. He joined O&rsquo;Donnell and
Espartero in 1854 against a revolutionary cabinet, and shortly
afterwards turned against O&rsquo;Donnell to assist the Democrats
and Progressists under Prim, Rivero, Castelar, and Sagasta in
the unsuccessful movements of 1866, and was obliged to go
abroad. His political career had not prevented Martos from
rising into note at the bar, where he was successful for forty
years. After remaining abroad three years, he returned to
Spain to take his seat in the Cortes of 1869 after the revolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page804" id="page804"></a>804</span>
of 1868. Throughout the revolutionary period he represented
in cabinets with Prim, Serrano and Ruiz Zorilla, and lastly under
King Amadeus, the advanced Radical tendencies of the men
who wanted to give Spain a democratic monarchy. After the
abdication of Amadeus of Savoy, Martos played a prominent
part in the proclamation of the federal republic, in the struggle
between the executive of that republic and the permanent
committee of the Cortes, backed by the generals and militia,
who nearly put an end to the executive and republic in April
1873. When the republicans triumphed Martos retired into
exile, and soon afterwards into private life. He reappeared for
a few months after General Pavia&rsquo;s <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> in January 1874, to
join a coalition cabinet formed by Marshal Serrano, with Sagasta
and Ulloa. Martos returned to the Bar in May 1874, and quietly
looked on when the restoration took place at the end of that
year. He stuck to his democratic ideals for some years, even
going to Biarritz in 1881 to be present at a republican congress
presided over by Ruiz Zorilla. Shortly afterwards Martos joined
the dynastic Left organized by Marshal Serrano, General Lopez
Dominguez, and Moret, Becerra, Balaguer, and other quondam
revolutionaries. He sat in several parliaments of the reign
of Alphonso XII. and of the regency of Queen Christina, joined
the dynastic Liberals under Sagasta, and gave Sagasta not a
little trouble when the latter allowed him to preside over the
House of Deputies. Having failed to form a rival party against
Sagasta, Martos subsided into political insignificance, despite
his great talent as an orator and debater, and died in Madrid on
the 16th of January 1893.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTYN, HENRY<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1781-1812), English missionary to India,
was born on the 18th of February 1781, at Truro, Cornwall.
His father, John Martyn, was a &ldquo;captain&rdquo; or mine-agent at
Gwennap. The lad was educated at Truro grammar school
under Dr Cardew, entered St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, in
the autumn of 1797, and was senior wrangler and first Smith&rsquo;s
prizeman in 1801. In 1802 he was chosen a fellow of his college.
He had intended to go to the bar, but in the October term of 1802
he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done
in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time
afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, the apostle of the
Indians of North America. He resolved, accordingly, to become
a Christian missionary. On the 22nd of October, 1803, he was
ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as
Simeon&rsquo;s curate at the church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of
the neighbouring parish of Lolworth. He was about to offer
his services to the Church Missionary Society, when a disaster in
Cornwall deprived him and his unmarried sister of the provision
their father had made for them, and rendered it necessary that
he should obtain a salary that would support her as well as
himself. He accordingly obtained a chaplaincy under the East
India Company and left for India on the 5th of July 1805. For
some months he was stationed at Aldeen, near Serampur; in
October 1806 he proceeded to Dinapur, where he was soon able
to conduct worship among the natives in the vernacular, and
established schools. In April 1809 he was transferred to
Cawnpore, where he preached in his own compound, in spite of
interruptions and threats. He occupied himself in linguistic
study, and had already, during his residence at Dinapur, been
engaged in revising the sheets of his Hindostani version of the
New Testament. He now translated the whole of the New
Testament into Hindi also, and into Persian twice. He translated
the Psalms into Persian, the Gospels into Judaeo-Persic,
and the Prayer-book into Hindostani, in spite of ill-health and
&ldquo;the pride, pedantry and fury of his chief munshi Sabat.&rdquo;
Ordered by the doctors to take a sea voyage, he obtained leave
to go to Persia and correct his Persian New Testament, whence
he wished to go to Arabia, and there compose an Arabic version.
Accordingly, on the 1st of October 1810, having seen his work
at Cawnpore crowned on the previous day by the opening of
a church, he left for Calcutta, whence he sailed on the 7th of
January 1811, for Bombay, which he reached on his thirtieth
birthday. From Bombay he set out for Bushire, bearing letters
from Sir John Malcolm to men of position there, as also at Shiraz
and Isfahan. After an exhausting journey from the coast he
reached Shiraz, and was soon plunged into discussion with the
disputants of all classes, &ldquo;Sufi, Mahommedan, Jew, and Jewish-Mahommedan,
even Armenian, all anxious to test their powers
of argument with the first English priest who had visited them.&rdquo;
Having made an unsuccessful journey to Tabriz to present the
shah with his translation of the New Testament, he was seized
with fever, and after a temporary recovery, had to seek a change
of climate. On the 12th of September 1812, he started with
two Armenian servants, crossed the Araxes, rode from Tabriz to
Erivan, from Erivan to Kars, from Kars to Erzerum, from
Erzerum to Chiflik, urged on from place to place by a thoughtless
Tatar guide, and, though the plague was raging at Tokat (near
Eski-Shehr in Asia Minor), he was compelled by prostration
to stop there. On the 6th of October he died. Macaulay&rsquo;s
youthful lines, written early in 1813, testify to the impression
made by his career.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTYN, JOHN<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1699-1768), English botanist, was born in
London on the 12th of September 1699. Originally intended for
a business career, he abandoned it in favour of medical and
botanical studies. He was one of the founders (with J. J. Dillen
and others) and the secretary of a botanical society which met for
a few years in the Rainbow Coffee-house, Watling Street; he also
started the <i>Grub Street Journal</i>, a weekly satirical review, which
lasted from 1730 to 1737. In 1732 he was appointed professor
of botany in Cambridge University, but, finding little encouragement
and hampered by lack of appliances, he soon discontinued
lecturing. He retained his professorship, however, till 1762,
when he resigned in favour of his son Thomas (1735-1825),
author of <i>Flora rustica</i> (1792-1794). Although he had not
taken a medical degree, he long practised as a physician at
Chelsea, where he died on the 29th of January 1768. His
reputation chiefly rests upon his <i>Historia plantarum rariorum</i>
(1728-1737), and his translation, with valuable agricultural and
botanical notes, of the <i>Eclogues</i> (1749) and <i>Georgics</i> (1741) of
Virgil. On resigning the botanical chair at Cambridge he presented
the university with a number of his botanical specimens

&ldquo;witness&rdquo; and often used in that sense in the New Testament
<i>e.g.</i> Matt, xviii. 16; Mark xiv. 63. During the conflict between
Paganism and Christianity when many Christians &ldquo;testified&rdquo;
to the truth of their convictions by sacrificing their lives, the
word assumed its modern technical sense. The beginnings of
this use are to be seen in such passages as Acts xxii. 20; Rev. ii.
13, xiii. 6. During the first three centuries the fortitude of
these &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; won the admiration of their brethren.
Ardent spirits craved the martyr&rsquo;s crown, and to confess Christ
in persecution was to attain a glory inferior only to that won by
those who actually died. Confessors were visited in prison,
martyrs&rsquo; graves were scenes of pilgrimage, and the day on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page805" id="page805"></a>805</span>
they suffered was celebrated as the birthday of their glory.
Martyrology was the most popular literature in the early Church.
While the honour paid to martyrdom was a great support to early
champions of the faith, it was attended by serious evils. It was
thought that martyrdom would atone for sin, and imprisoned
confessors not only issued to the Churches commands which
were regarded almost as inspired utterances, but granted pardons
in rash profusion to those who had been excommunicated by the
regular clergy, a practice which caused Cyprian and his fellow
bishops much difficulty. The zeal of Ignatius (<i>c.</i> 115), who begs
the Roman Church to do nothing to avert from him the martyr&rsquo;s
death, was natural enough in a spiritual knight-errant, but with
others in later days, especially in Phrygia and North Africa, the
passion became artificial. Fanatics sought death by insulting
the magistrates or by breaking idols, and in their enthusiasm
for martyrdom became self-centred and forgetful of their normal
duty. None the less it is true that these men and women endured
torments, often unthinkable in their cruelty, and death rather
than abandon their faith. The same phenomena have been
witnessed, not only in the conflicts within the Church that
marked the 13th to the 16th centuries, but in the different
mission fields, and particularly in Madagascar and China.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARTYROLOGY,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> a catalogue or list of <i>martyrs</i>, or, more
exactly, of saints, arranged in the order of their anniversaries.
This is the now accepted meaning in the Latin Church. In the
Greek Church the nearest equivalent to the martyrology is the
Synaxarium (<i>q.v.</i>). As regards form, we should distinguish
between simple martyrologies, which consist merely of an
enumeration of names, and historical martyrologies, which also
include stories or biographical details. As regards documents,
the most important distinction is between local and general
martyrologies. The former give a list of the festivals of some
particular Church; the latter are the result of a combination of
several local martyrologies. We may add certain compilations
of a factitious character, to which the name of martyrology is
given by analogy, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>Martyrologe universel</i> of Châtelain
(1709). As types of local martyrologies we may quote that of
Rome, formed from the <i>Depositio martyrum</i> and the <i>Depositio
episcoporum</i> of the chronograph of 354; the Gothic calendar of
Ulfila&rsquo;s Bible, the calendar of Carthage published by Mabillon,
the calendar of fasts and vigils of the Church of Tours, going
back as far as Bishop Perpetuus (d. 490), and preserved in the
<i>Historia francorum</i> (xi. 31) of Gregory of Tours. The Syriac
martyrology discovered by Wright (<i>Journal of Sacred Literature</i>,
1866) gives the idea of a general martyrology. The most
important ancient martyrology preserved to the present day is
the compilation falsely attributed to St Jerome, which in its
present form goes back to the end of the 6th century. It is the
result of the combination of a general martyrology of the Eastern
Churches, a local martyrology of the Church of Rome, some
general martyrologies of Italy and Africa, and a series of local
martyrologies of Gaul. The task of critics is to distinguish
between its various constituent elements. Unfortunately, this
document has reached us in a lamentable condition. The proper
names are distorted, repeated or misplaced, and in many places
the text is so corrupt that it is impossible to understand it.
With the exception of a few traces of borrowings from the
Passions of the martyrs, the compilation is in the form of a
simple martyrology. Of the best-known historical martyrologies
the oldest are those which go under the name of Bede and of
Florus (<i>Acta sanctorum Martii</i>, vol. ii.); of Wandelbert, a
monk of Prüm (842); of Rhabanus Maurus (<i>c.</i> 845); of Ado
(d. 875); of Notker (896); and of Wolfhard (<i>c.</i> 896 v. <i>Analecta
bollandiana</i>, xvii. 11). The most famous is that of Usuard
(<i>c.</i> 875), on which the Roman martyrology was based. The first
edition of the Roman martyrology appeared at Rome in 1583.
The third edition, which appeared in 1584, was approved by
Gregory XIII., who imposed the Roman martyrology upon the
whole Church. In 1586 Baronius published his annotated
edition, which in spite of its omissions and inaccuracies is a
mine of valuable information.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief works on the martyrologies are those of Rosweyde, who
in 1613 published at Antwerp the martyrology of Ado (also edition
of Giorgi, Rome, 1745); of Sollerius, to whom we owe a learned
edition of Usuard (<i>Acta sanctorum Junii</i>, vols. vi. and vii.); and of
Fiorentini, who published in 1688 an annotated edition of the <i>Martyrology
of St Jerome</i>. The critical edition of the latter by J. B. de
Rossi and Mgr. L. Duchesne, was published in 1894, in vol. ii. of the
<i>Acta sanctorum Novembris</i>. The historical martyrologies taken as
a whole have been studied by Dom Quentin (1908). There are also
numerous editions of calendars or martyrologies of less universal
interest, and commentaries upon them. Mention ought to be made
of the famous calendar of Naples, commented on by Mazocchi

<p><span class="bold">MARULLUS, MICHAEL TARCHANIOTA<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (d. 1500), Greek
scholar, poet, and soldier, was born at Constantinople. In
1453, when the Turks captured Constantinople, he was taken
to Ancona in Italy, where he became the friend and pupil of
J. J. Pontanus, with whom his name is associated by Ariosto
(<i>Orl. Fur.</i> xxxvii. 8). He received his education at Florence,
where he obtained the patronage of Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici. He was
the author of epigrams and <i>hymni naturales</i>, in which he happily
imitated Lucretius. He took no part in the work of translation,
then the favourite exercise of scholars, but he was understood
to be planning some great work when he was drowned, on the
10th of April 1500, in the river Cecina near Volterra. He was a
bitter enemy of Politian, whose successful rival he had been in the
affections of the beautiful and learned Alessandra Scala. He is
remembered chiefly for the brilliant emendations on Lucretius
which he left unpublished; these were used for the Juntine
edition (Munro&rsquo;s <i>Lucretius</i>, Introduction).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARUM, MARTIN VAN<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> (1750-1837), Dutch man of science,
was born on the 20th of March 1750 at Groningen, where he
graduated in medicine and philosophy. He began to practise
medicine at Haarlem, but devoted himself mainly to lecturing
on physical subjects. He became secretary of the scientific
society of that city, and under his management the society was
advanced to the position of one of the most noted in Europe.
He was also entrusted with the care of the collection left to
Haarlem by P. Teyler van der Hulst (1702-1778). His name
is not associated with any discovery of the first order, but his
researches (especially in connexion with electricity) were remarkable
for their number and variety. He died at Haarlem on the
26th of December 1837.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARVELL, ANDREW<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (1621-1678), English poet and satirist,
son of Andrew Marvell and his wife Anne Pease, was born at the
rectory house, Winestead, in the Holderness division of Yorkshire,
on the 31st of March 1621. In 1624 his father exchanged
the living of Winestead for the mastership of Hull grammar
school. He also became lecturer at Holy Trinity Church and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page806" id="page806"></a>806</span>
master of the Charterhouse in the same town. Thomas Fuller
(<i>Worthies of England</i>, ed. 1811, i. 165) describes him as &ldquo;a most
excellent preacher.&rdquo; The younger Marvell was educated at
Hull grammar school until his thirteenth year, when he matriculated
on the 14th of December 1633 (according to a doubtful
statement in Wood&rsquo;s <i>Athen. oxon.</i>) at Trinity College, Cambridge.
It is related by his early biographer, Thomas Cooke, that he was
induced by some Jesuit priests to leave the university. After
some months he was discovered by his father in a bookseller&rsquo;s
shop in London, and returned to Cambridge.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He contributed
two poems to the <i>Musa cantabrigiensis</i> in 1637, and in the
following year he received a scholarship at Trinity College, and
took his B.A. degree in 1639. His father was drowned in 1640
while crossing the Humber in company with the daughter of
a Mrs Skinner, almost certainly connected with the Cyriack
Skinner to whom two of Milton&rsquo;s sonnets are addressed. It is
said that Mrs Skinner adopted Marvell and provided for him at
her death. The Conclusion Book of Trinity College, Cambridge,
registers the decision (Sept. 24, 1641) that he with others should
be excluded from further advantages from the college either
because they were married, or did not attend their &ldquo;days&rdquo; or
&ldquo;acts.&rdquo; He travelled for four years on the Continent, visiting
Holland, France, Italy and Spain. In Rome he met Richard
Flecknoe, whom he satirized in the amusing verses on &ldquo;Flecnoe,
an English priest at Rome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Marvell ranks as a great Puritan poet his sympathies
were at first with Charles I., and in the lines on &ldquo;Tom May&rsquo;s
Death&rdquo; he found no words too strong to express his scorn for the
historian of the Long Parliament. He himself was no partisan,
but had a passion for law and order. He acquiesced, accordingly,
in the strong rule of Cromwell, but in his famous &ldquo;Horatian Ode
upon Cromwell&rsquo;s Return from Ireland&rdquo; (1650)<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> he inserts a
tribute to the courage and dignity of Charles I., which forms the
best-known section of the poem. In 1650 he became tutor to
Lord Fairfax&rsquo;s daughter Mary, afterwards duchess of Buckingham,
then in her twelfth year. During his life with the Fairfaxes
at Nunappleton, Yorkshire, he wrote the poems &ldquo;Upon
the Hill and Grove at Billborow&rdquo; and &ldquo;On Appleton House.&rdquo;
Doubtless the other poems on country life, and his exquisite
&ldquo;garden poetry&rdquo; may be referred to this period. &ldquo;Clorinda
and Damon&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Nymph complaining for the Death of her
Faun&rdquo; are good examples of the beauty and simplicity of much
of this early verse. But he had affinities with John Donne and
the metaphysical poets, and could be obscure on occasion.</p>

<p>Marvell was acquainted with Milton probably through their
common friends, the Skinners, and in February 1653 Milton sent
him with a letter to the lord president of the council, John
Bradshaw, recommending him as &ldquo;a man of singular desert for
the state to make use of,&rdquo; and suggesting his appointment as
assistant to himself in his duties as foreign secretary. The
appointment was, however, given at the time to Philip Meadows,
and Marvell became tutor to Cromwell&rsquo;s ward, William Dutton.
In 1653 he was established with his pupil at Eton in the house of
John Oxenbridge, then a fellow of the college, but formerly a
minister in the Bermudas. No doubt the well-known verses,
&ldquo;Bermudas,&rdquo; were inspired by intercourse with the Oxenbridges.
At Eton he enjoyed the society of John Hales, then living in
retirement. He was employed by Milton in 1654 to convey to
Bradshaw a copy of the <i>Defensio secunda</i>, and the letter to
Milton in which he describes the reception of the gift is preserved.
When the secretaryship again fell vacant in 1657 Marvell was
appointed, and retained the appointment until the accession of
Charles II. During this period he wrote many political poems,
all of them displaying admiration for Cromwell. His &ldquo;Poem
upon the Death of his late Highness the Lord Protector&rdquo; has
been unfavourably compared to Edmund Waller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Panegyric,&rdquo;
but Marvell&rsquo;s poem is inspired with affection.</p>

<p>Marvell&rsquo;s connexion with Hull had <span class="correction" title="amended from heen">been</span> strengthened by the
marriages of his sisters with persons of local importance, and in
January 1659 he was elected to represent the borough in parliament.
He was re-elected in 1660, again in 1661, and continued
to represent the town until his death. According to Milton&rsquo;s
nephew, Edward Phillips, the poet owed his safety at the
Restoration largely to the efforts of Marvell, who &ldquo;made a
considerable party for him&rdquo; in the House of Commons. From
1663 to 1665 he acted as secretary to Charles Howard, 1st earl
of Carlisle, on his difficult and unsuccessful embassy to Muscovy,
Sweden, and Denmark; and this is the only official post he filled
during the reign of Charles. With the exception of this absence,
for which he had leave from his constituents, and of shorter
intervals of travel on private business which took him to Holland,
Marvell was constant in his parliamentary attendance to the day
of his death. He seldom spoke in the House, but his parliamentary
influence is established by other evidence. He was an excellent
man of affairs, and looked after the special interests of the port
of Hull. He was a member of the corporation of Trinity House,
both in London and Hull, and became a younger warden of
the London Trinity House. His correspondence with his constituents,
from 1660 to 1678, some 400 letters in all, printed by
Dr Grosart (<i>Complete Works</i>, vol. ii.), forms a source of information
all the more valuable because by a resolution passed at
the Restoration the publication of the proceedings of the House
without leave was forbidden. He made it a point of duty to
write at each post&mdash;that is, every two or three days&mdash;both on
local interests and on all matters of public interest. The discreet
reserve of these letters, natural at a time when the post office
was a favourite source of information to the government,
contrasts curiously with the freedom of the few private letters
which state opinions as well as facts. Marvell&rsquo;s constituents,
in their turn, were not unmindful of their member. He makes
frequent references to their presents, usually of Hull ale and
of salmon, and he regularly drew from them the wages of a
member, six-and-eightpence a day during session.</p>

<p>The development of Marvell&rsquo;s political opinions may be traced
in the satirical verse he published during the reign of Charles II.,
and in his private letters. With all his admiration for Cromwell
he had retained his sympathies with the royal house, and had
loyally accepted the Restoration. In 1667 the Dutch fleet sailed
up the Thames, and Marvell expressed his wrath at the gross
mismanagement of public affairs in &ldquo;Last Instructions to a
Painter,&rdquo; a satire which was published as a broadside and of
course remained anonymous. Edmund Waller had published
in 1665 a gratulatory poem on the duke of York&rsquo;s victory in that
year over the Dutch as &ldquo;Instructions to a Painter for the drawing
up and posture of his Majesty&rsquo;s forces at sea....&rdquo; A similar form
was adopted in Sir John Denham&rsquo;s four satirical &ldquo;Directions to
a Painter,&rdquo; and Marvell writes on the same model. His indignation
was well grounded, but he had no scruples in the choice of
the weapons he employed in his warfare against the corruption of
the court, which he paints even blacker than do contemporary
memoir writers; and his satire often descends to the level of the
lampoon. The most inexcusable of his scandalous verses are
perhaps those on the duchess of York. In the same year he
attacked Lord Clarendon, evidently hoping that with the removal
of the &ldquo;betrayer of England and Flanders&rdquo; matters would
improve. But in 1672 when he wrote his &ldquo;Poem on the Statue
in the Stocks-Market&rdquo; he had no illusions left about Charles,
whom he describes as too often &ldquo;purchased and sold,&rdquo; though
he concludes with &ldquo;Yet we&rsquo;d rather have him than his bigoted
brother.&rdquo; &ldquo;An Historical Poem,&rdquo; &ldquo;Advice to a Painter,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Britannia and Raleigh&rdquo; urge the same advice in grave
language. In the last-named poem, probably written early in
1674, Raleigh pleads that &ldquo;&rsquo;tis god-like good to save a fallen
king,&rdquo; but Britannia has at length decided that the tyrant cannot
be divided from the Stuart, and proposes to reform the state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page807" id="page807"></a>807</span>
on the republican model of Venice. These and other equally
bold satires were probably handed round in MS., or secretly
printed, and it was not until after the Revolution that they were
collected with those of other writers in <i>Poems on Affairs of State</i>
(3 pts., 1689; 4 pts., 1703-1707). Marvell&rsquo;s controversial prose
writings are wittier than his verse satires, and are free from the
scurrility which defaces the &ldquo;Last Instructions to a Painter.&rdquo;
A short and brilliant example of his irony is &ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s
Most Gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament&rdquo; (printed
in <i>Grosart</i>, ii. 431 seq.), in which Charles is made to take the
house into the friendliest confidence on his domestic affairs.</p>

<p>Marvell was among the masters of Jonathan Swift, who, in the
&ldquo;Apology&rdquo; prefixed to the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>, wrote that his answer
to Samuel Parker could be still read with pleasure, although the
pamphlets that provoked it were long since forgotten. Parker
had written a <i>Discourse of Ecclesiastical Politye</i> (1670) and other
polemics against Dissenters, to which Marvell replied in <i>The
Rehearsal Transposed</i> (2 pts., 1672 and 1673). The book contains
some passages of dignified eloquence, and some coarse vituperation,
but the prevailing tone is that of grave and ironical banter
of Parker as &ldquo;Mr Bayes.&rdquo; Parker was attacked, says Bishop
Burnet (<i>Hist. of His Own Time</i>, ed. 1823, i. 451), &ldquo;by the
liveliest droll of the age, who writ in a burlesque strain, but with
so peculiar and entertaining a conduct, that, from the king down
to the tradesman, his books were read with great pleasure.&rdquo;
He certainly humbled Parker, but whether this effect extended,
as Burnet asserts, to the whole party, is doubtful. Parker had
intimated that Milton had a share in the first part of Marvell&rsquo;s
reply. This Marvell emphatically denied (<i>Grosart</i>, iii. 498).
He points out that Parker had, like Milton, profited by the royal
clemency, and that he had first met him at Milton&rsquo;s house. He
takes the opportunity to praise Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;great learning and
sharpness of wit,&rdquo; and to the second edition of <i>Paradise
Lost</i> (1674) he contributed some verses of just and eloquent
praise.</p>

<p>His <i>Mr Smirke, or the Divine in Mode ...</i> (1676) was a defence
of Herbert Croft, bishop of Hereford, against the criticisms of
Dr Francis Turner, master of St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. A
far more important work was <i>An Account of the Growth of Popery
and Arbitrary Government in England, more particularly from
the Long Prorogation of Parliament ...</i> (1677). This pamphlet
was written in the same outspoken tone as the verse satires,
and brought against the court the indictment of nursing designs
to establish absolute monarchy and the Roman Catholic religion
at the same time. A reward was offered for the author, whose
identity was evidently suspected, and it is said that Marvell was
in danger of assassination. He died on the 16th of August 1678
in consequence of an overdose of an opiate taken during an
attack of ague. He was buried in the church of St Giles-in-the-Fields,
London. Joint administration of his estate was granted
to one of his creditors, and to his widow, Mary Marvell, of whom
we have no previous mention.</p>

<p>As a humorist, and as a great &ldquo;parliament man,&rdquo; no name is
of more interest to a student of the reign of Charles II. than that
of Marvell. He had friends among the republican thinkers of
the times. Aubrey says that he was intimate with James
Harrington, the author of <i>Oceana</i>, and he was probably a member
of the &ldquo;Rota&rdquo; club. In the heyday of political infamy, he, a
needy man, obliged to accept wages from his constituents, kept
his political virtue unspotted, and he stood throughout his career
as the champion of moderate and tolerant measures. There is
a story that his old schoolfellow, Danby, was sent by the king to
offer the incorruptible poet a place at court and a gift of £1000,
which Marvell refused with the words: &ldquo;I live here to serve
my constituents: the ministry may seek men for their purpose;
I am not one.&rdquo; When self-indulgence was the ordinary habit
of town life, Marvell was a temperate man. His personal
appearance is described by John Aubrey: &ldquo;He was of a middling
stature, pretty strong set, roundish faced, cherry cheeked, hazel
eyed, brown haired. In his conversation he was modest and of
very few words.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lives of Eminent Persons,&rdquo; printed in
<i>Letters ... in the 17th and 18th Centuries</i>, 1813).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among Marvell&rsquo;s works is also a <i>Defence of John Howe on God&rsquo;s
Prescience ...</i> (1678), and among the spurious works fathered on
him are: <i>A Seasonable Argument ... for a new Parliament</i> (1677),
<i>A Seasonable Question and a Useful Answer ...</i> (1676), <i>A Letter
from a Parliament Man ...</i> (1675), and a translation of <i>Suetonius</i>
(1672). Marvell&rsquo;s satires were no doubt first printed as broadsides,
but very few are still extant in that form. Such of his poems as
were printed during his lifetime appeared in collections of other
men&rsquo;s works. The earliest edition of his non-political verse is
<i>Miscellaneous Poems</i> (1681), edited by his wife, Mary Marvell. The
political satires were printed as <i>A Collection of Poems on Affairs of
State, by A&mdash;&mdash; M&mdash;&mdash;l, Esq. and other Eminent Wits</i> (1689), with
second and third parts in the same year. The works of Andrew
Marvell contained in these two publications were also edited by
Thomas Cooke (2 vols., 1726), who added some letters. Cooke&rsquo;s
edition was reprinted by Thomas Davies in 1772. Marvell&rsquo;s next
editor was Captain Thompson of Hull, who was connected with the
poet&rsquo;s family, and made further additions from a commonplace
book since lost. Other editions followed, but were superseded by
Dr A. B. Grosart&rsquo;s laborious work, which, in spite of many defects
of style, remains indispensable to the student. <i>The Complete Works
in Verse and Prose of Andrew Marvell, M.P.</i> (4 vols., 1872-1875)
forms part of his &ldquo;Fuller Worthies Library.&rdquo; See also the admirable
edition of the <i>Poems and Satires of Andrew Marvell ...</i> (2 vols.,
1892) in the &ldquo;Muses&rsquo; Library,&rdquo; where a full bibliography of his works
and of the commentaries on them is provided; also <i>The Poems and
some Satires of Andrew Marvell</i> (ed. Edward Wright, 1904), and

<p><span class="bold">MARX, HEINRICH KARL<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (1818-1883), German socialist, and
head of the International Working Men&rsquo;s Association, was born
on the 5th of May 1818 in Trèves (Rhenish Prussia). His father,
a Jewish lawyer, in 1824 went over to Christianity, and he and
his whole family were baptized as Christian Protestants. The
son went to the high grammar school at Trèves, and from 1835
to the universities of Bonn and Berlin. He studied first law,
then history and philosophy, and in 1841 took the degree of
doctor of philosophy. In Berlin he had close intimacy with the
most prominent representatives of the young Hegelians&mdash;the
brothers Bruno and Edgar Bauer and their circle, the so-called
&ldquo;Freien.&rdquo; He at first intended to settle as a lecturer at Bonn
University, but his Radical views made a university career out
of the question, and he accepted work on a Radical paper, the
<i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>, which expounded the ideas of the most
advanced section of the Rhenish Radical <i>bourgeoisie</i>. In October
1842 he became one of the editors of this paper, which, however,
after an incessant struggle with press censors, was suppressed
in the beginning of 1843. In the summer of this year Marx
married Jenny von Westphalen, the daughter of a high government
official. Through her mother Jenny von Westphalen was
a lineal descendant of the earl of Argyle, who was beheaded under
James II. She was a most faithful companion to Marx during
all the vicissitudes of his career, and died on the 2nd of December
1881; he outliving her only fifteen months.</p>

<p>Already in the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> some socialist voices had
been audible, couched in a somewhat philosophical strain. Marx,
though not accepting these views, refused to criticize them
until he had studied the question thoroughly. For this purpose
he went in the autumn of 1843 to Paris, where the socialist
movement was then at its intellectual zenith, and where he,
together with Arnold Ruge, the well-known literary leader of
Radical Hegelianism, was to edit a review, the <i>Deutsch-französische
Jahrbücher</i>, of which, however, only one number appeared.
It contained two articles by Marx&mdash;a criticism of Bruno Bauer&rsquo;s
treatment of the Jewish question, and an introduction to a
criticism of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy of the law. The first concluded
that the social emancipation of the Jews could only be achieved
together with the emancipation of society from Judaism, <i>i.e.</i>
commercialism. The second declared that in Germany no partial
political emancipation was possible; there was now only one class
from which a real and reckless fight against authority was to
be expected&mdash;namely, the proletariate. But the proletariate
could not emancipate itself except by breaking all the chains,
by dissolving the whole constituted society, by recreating man
as a member of the human society in the place of established
states and classes. &ldquo;Then the day of German resurrection will
be announced by the crowing of the Gallican cock.&rdquo; Both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page808" id="page808"></a>808</span>
articles thus relegated the solution of the questions then prominent
in Germany to the advent of socialism, and so far
resembled in principle other socialist publications of the time.
But the way of reasoning was different, and the final words
of the last quoted sentence pointed to a political revolution,
to begin in France as soon as the industrial evolution had
created a sufficiently strong proletariate. In contradistinction
to most of the socialists of the day, Marx laid stress
upon the political struggle as the lever of social emancipation.
In some letters which formed part of a correspondence
between Marx, Ruge, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Mikhail Bakunin,
published as an introduction to the review, this opposition
of Marx to socialistic &ldquo;dogmatism&rdquo; was enunciated in a still
more pronounced form: &ldquo;Nothing prevents us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from
combining our criticism with the criticism of politics, from
participating in politics, and consequently in real struggles. We
will not, then, oppose the world like doctrinarians with a new
principle: here is truth, kneel down here! We expose new principles
to the world out of the principles of the world itself. We
don&rsquo;t tell it: &lsquo;Give up your struggles, they are rubbish, we will
show you the true war-cry.&rsquo; We explain to it only the real
object for which it struggles, and consciousness is a thing it must
acquire even if it objects to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Paris Marx met <span class="sc">Friedrich Engels</span> (1820-1895), from whom
the <i>Deutsch-französische Jahrbücher</i> had two articles&mdash;a powerfully
written outline of a criticism of political economy, and a
letter on Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Past and Present</i>. Engels, the son of a wealthy
cotton-spinner, was born in 1820 at Barmen. Although destined
by his father for a commercial career, he attended a classical
school, and during his apprenticeship and whilst undergoing in
Berlin his one year&rsquo;s military service, he had given up part of his
free hours to philosophical studies. In Berlin he had frequented
the society of the &ldquo;Freien,&rdquo; and had written letters to the
<i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>. In 1842 he had gone to England, his father&rsquo;s
firm having a factory near Manchester, and had entered into connexion
with the Owenite and Chartist movements, as well as
with German communists. He contributed to Owen&rsquo;s <i>New Moral
World an</i>d to the Chartist <i>Northern Star</i>, gave up much of his
abstract speculative reasoning for a more positivist conception of
things, and took to economic studies. Now, in September 1844,
on a short stay in Paris, he visited Marx, and the two found that
in regard to all theoretical points there was perfect agreement
between them. From that visit dates the close friendship and
uninterrupted collaboration and exchange of ideas which lasted
during their lives, so that even some of Marx&rsquo;s subsequent works,
which he published under his own name, are more or less also the
work of Engels. The first result of their collaboration was the
book <i>Die heilige Familie oder Kritik der kritischen Kritik, gegen
Bruno Bauer und Konsorten</i>, a scathing exposition of the perverseness
of the high-sounding speculative radicalism of Bauer
and the other Berlin &ldquo;Freie.&rdquo; By aid of an analysis, which,
though not free from exaggeration and a certain diffuseness,
bears testimony to the great learning of Marx and the vigorous
discerning faculty of both the authors, it is shown that the
supposed superior criticism&mdash;the &ldquo;critical criticism&rdquo; of the
Bauer school, based upon the doctrine of a &ldquo;self-conscious&rdquo;
idea, represented by or incarnated in the critic&mdash;was in fact
inferior to the older Hegelian idealism. The socialist and
working-class movements in Great Britain, France and Germany
are defended against the superior criticism of the &ldquo;holy&rdquo;
Bauer family.</p>

<p>In Paris, where he had very intimate intercourse with Heinrich
Heine, who always speaks of him with the greatest respect,
and some of whose poems were suggested by Marx, the latter
contributed to a Radical magazine, the <i>Vorwärts</i>; but in consequence
of a request by the Prussian government, nearly the whole
staff of the magazine soon got orders to leave France. Marx
now went to Brussels, where he shortly afterwards was joined
by Engels. In Brussels he published his second great work,
<i>La Misère de la philosophie</i>, a sharp rejoinder to the <i>Philosophie
de la misère ou contradictions économiques</i> of J. P. Proudhon. In
this he deals with Proudhon, whom in the former work he had
defended against the Bauers, not less severely than with the
latter. It is shown that in many points Proudhon is inferior to
both the middle-class economists and the socialists, that his
somewhat noisily proclaimed discoveries in regard to political
economy were made long before by English socialists, and that
his main remedies, the &ldquo;constitution of the labour-value&rdquo; and
the establishment of exchange bazaars, were but a repetition of
what English socialists had already worked out much more
thoroughly and more consistently. Altogether the book shows
remarkable knowledge of political economy. In justice to
Proudhon, it must be added that it is more often his mode of
speaking than the thought underlying the attacked sentences
that is hit by Marx&rsquo;s criticism. In Brussels Marx and Engels
also wrote a number of essays, wherein they criticized the
German literary representatives of that kind of socialism and
philosophic radicalism which was mainly influenced by the
writings of Ludwig Feuerbach, and deduced its theorems or
postulates from speculations on the &ldquo;nature of man.&rdquo; They
mockingly nicknamed this kind of socialism &ldquo;German or True
Socialism,&rdquo; and ridiculed the idea that by disregarding historical
and class distinctions a conception of society and socialism
superior to that of the English and French workers and theorists
could be obtained. Some of these essays were published at the
time, two or three, curiously enough, by one of the attacked
writers in his own magazine; one, a criticism of Feuerbach
himself, was in a modified form published by Engels in 1885, but
others have remained in manuscript. They were at first intended
for publication in two volumes as a criticism of post-Hegelian
German philosophy, but the Revolution of 1848 postponed for a
time all interest in theoretical discussions.</p>

<p>In Brussels Marx and Engels came into still closer contact
with the socialist working-class movement. They founded a
German workers&rsquo; society, acquired a local German weekly, the
<i>Brüsseller deutsche Zeitung</i>, and finally joined a communistic
society of German workers, the &ldquo;League of the Just,&rdquo; a secret
society which had its main branches in London, Paris, Brussels
and several Swiss towns. For this league, which till then had
adhered to the rough-and-ready communism of the gifted German
workman Wilhelm Weitling, but which now called itself &ldquo;League
of the Communists,&rdquo; and gave up its leanings towards conspiracy
and became an educational and propagandistic body, Marx and
Engels at the end of 1847 wrote their famous pamphlet, <i>Manifest
der Kommunisten</i>. It was a concise exposition of the history
of the working-class movement in modern society according to
their views, to which was added a critical survey of the existing
socialist and communist literature, and an explanation of the
attitude of the Communists towards the advanced opposition
parties in the different countries. Scarcely was the manifesto
printed when, in February 1848, the Revolution broke out in
France, and &ldquo;the crowing of the Gallican cock&rdquo; gave the signal
for an upheaval in Germany such as Marx had prophesied. After
a short stay in France, Marx and Engels went to Cologne in
May 1848, and there with some friends they founded the <i>Neue
rheinische Zeitung</i>, with the sub-title &ldquo;An Organ of Democracy,&rdquo;
a political daily paper on a large scale, of which Marx was the
chief editor. They took a frankly revolutionary attitude, and
directed their criticism to a great extent against the middle-class
democratic parties, who, by evading all decisive issues, delayed
the achievement of the upheaval. When in November 1848 the
king of Prussia dissolved the National Assembly, Marx and his
friends advocated the non-payment of taxes and the organization
of armed resistance. Then the state of siege was declared in
Cologne, the <i>Neue rheinische Zeitung</i> was suspended, and Marx
was put on trial for high treason. He was unanimously acquitted
by a middle-class jury, but in May 1849 he was expelled from
Prussian territory. He went to Paris, but was soon given the
option of either leaving France or settling at a small provincial
place. He preferred the former, and went to England. He
settled in London, and remained there for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>At first he tried to reorganize the Communist League; but
soon a conflict broke out in its ranks, and after some of its
members had been tried in Germany and condemned for high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page809" id="page809"></a>809</span>
treason, Marx, who had done everything to save the accused,
dissolved the Communist League altogether. Nor was a literary
enterprise, a review, also called the <i>Neue rheinische Zeitung</i>,
more successful; only six numbers of it were issued. It contained,
however, some very remarkable contributions; and a series of
articles on the career of the French Revolution of 1848, which
first appeared there, was in 1895 published by Engels in book
form under the title of <i>Die Klassenkämpfe in Frankreich von
1848&rdquo;</i> by Karl Marx.&rdquo; Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Latter Day Pamphlets</i>, published
at that time, met with a very vehement criticism in the
<i>Neue rheinische Zeitung</i>. The endeavours of Ernest Jones and
others to revive the Chartist movement were heartily supported
by Marx, who contributed to several of the Chartist journals of
the period, mostly, if not wholly, without getting or asking payment.
He lived at this time in great financial straits, occupied
a few small rooms in Dean Street, Soho, and all his children
then born died very young. At length he was invited to
write letters for the <i>New York Tribune</i>, whose staff consisted
of advanced democrats and socialists of the Fourierist school.
For these letters he was paid at the rate of a guinea each.
Part of them, dealing with the Eastern Question and the
Crimean War, were republished in 1897 (London, Sonnenschein).
Some were even at the time reprinted in pamphlet form.
The co-operation of Marx, who was determinedly anti-Russian,
since Russia was the leading reactionary power in
Europe, was obtained by David Urquhart and his followers.
A number of Marx&rsquo;s articles were issued as pamphlets by the
Urquhartite committees, and Marx wrote a series of articles
on the diplomatic history of the 18th century for the Urquhartite
<i>Free Press</i> (Sheffield and London, 1856-1857). When
in 1859 the Franco-Austrian War about Italy broke out, Marx
denounced it as a Franco-Russian intrigue, directed against
Germany on the one hand and the revolutionary movement in
France on the other. He opposed those democrats who supported
a war which in their eyes aimed at the independence of
the Italian nation and promised to weaken Austria, whose
superiority in Germany was the hindrance to German unity.
Violent derogatory remarks directed against him by the well-known
naturalist Karl Vogt gave occasion to a not less violent
rejoinder, <i>Herr Vogt</i>, a book full of interesting material for the
student of modern history. Marx&rsquo;s contention, that Vogt acted
as an agent of the Bonapartist clique, seems to have been well
founded, whilst it must be an open question how far Vogt acted
from dishonourable motives. The discussions raised by the war
also resulted in a great estrangement between Marx and Ferdinand
Lassalle. Lassalle had taken a similar view of the war to
that advocated by Vogt, and fought tooth and nail for it in
letters to Marx. In the same year, 1859, Marx published as a
first result of his renewed economic studies the book <i>Zur Kritik
der politischen Ökonomie</i>. It was the first part of a much larger
work planned to cover the whole ground of political economy.
But Marx found that the arrangement of his materials did not
fully answer his purpose, and that many details had still to be
worked out. He consequently altered the whole plan and sat
down to rewrite the book, of which in 1867 he published the first
volume under the title <i>Das Kapital</i>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in 1864, the International Working Men&rsquo;s
Association was founded in London, and Marx became in fact
though not in name, the head of its general council. All its
addresses and proclamations were penned by him and explained
in lectures to the members of the council. The first years of the
International went smoothly enough. Marx was then at his
best. He displayed in the International a political sagacity and
toleration which compare most favourably with the spirit of
some of the publications of the Communist League. He was
more of its teacher than an agitator, and his expositions of such
subjects as education, trade unions, the working day, and co-operation
were highly instructive. He did not hurry on extreme
resolutions, but put his proposals in such a form that they could
be adopted by even the more backward sections, and yet
contained no concessions to reactionary tendencies. But this
condition of things was not permitted to go on. The anarchist
agitation of Bakunin, the Franco-German War, and the Paris
Commune created a state of things before which the International
succumbed. Passions and prejudices ran so high that it proved
impossible to maintain any sort of centralized federation. At
the congress of the Hague, September 1872, the general council
was removed from London to New York. But this was only
a makeshift, and in July 1876 the rest of the old International
was formally dissolved at a conference held in Philadelphia.
That its spirit had not passed away was shown by subsequent
international congresses, and by the growth and character of
socialist labour parties in different countries. They have mostly
founded their programmes on the basis of its principles, but
are not always in their details quite in accordance with Marx&rsquo;s
views. Thus the programme which the German socialist party
accepted at its congress in 1875 was very severely criticized by
Marx. This criticism, reprinted in 1891 in the review <i>Die neue
Zeit</i>, is of great importance for the analysis of Marx&rsquo;s conception
of socialism.</p>

<p>The dissolution of the International gave Marx an opportunity
of returning to his scientific work. He did not, however,
succeed in publishing further volumes of <i>Das Kapital</i>. In order
to make it&mdash;and especially the part dealing with property in
land&mdash;as complete as possible, he took up, as Engels tells us, a
number of new studies, but repeated illness interrupted his
researches, and on the 14th of March 1883 he passed quietly
away.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>From the manuscripts he left Engels compiled a second and a
third volume of <i>Das Kapital</i> by judiciously and elaborately using
complete and incomplete chapters, rough copies and excerpts,
which Marx had at different times written down. Much of the copy
used dates back to the &rsquo;sixties, <i>i.e.</i> represents the work as at first
conceived by Marx, so that, <i>e.g.</i>, the matter published as the third
volume was in the main written much earlier than the matter which
was used for compiling the second volume. The same applies to
the fourth volume. Although the work thus comprises the four
volumes promised in the preface to the book, it can only in a very
restricted sense be regarded as complete. In substance and demonstration
it must be regarded as a torso. And it is perhaps not quite
accidental that it should be so. Marx, if he had lived longer and
had enjoyed better health, would have given the world a much
greater amount of scientific work of high value than is now the case.
But it seems doubtful whether he would have brought <i>Das Kapital</i>,
his main work, to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Das Kapital</i> proposes to show up historically and critically the
whole mechanism of capitalist economy. The first volume deals
with the processes of producing capital, the second with the circulation
of capital, the third with the movements of capital as a whole,
whilst the fourth gives the history of the theories concerning capital.
Capital is, according to Marx, the means of appropriating <i>surplus-value</i>
as distinguished from ground rent (rent on every kind of
terrestrial property, such as land, mines, rivers, &amp;c., based upon the
monopolist nature of such property). Surplus-value is created in the
process of production only, it is this part of the value of the newly
created product which is not given to the workman as a return&mdash;the
<i>wage</i>&mdash;of the labour-force he expended in working. If at first taken
by the employer, it is in the different phases of economic intercourse
split up into the profit of industrial enterprise, commercial or
merchants&rsquo; profit, interest and ground rent. The value of every
commodity consists in the labour expended on it, and is measured
according to the time occupied by the labour employed on its production.
Labour in itself has no value, being only the measure of value,
but the labour-force of the workman has a value, the value of the
means required to maintain the worker in normal conditions of social
existence. Thus, in distinction to other commodities, in the determination
of the value of labour-force, besides the purely economical,
a <i>moral</i> and <i>historical</i> element enter. If to-day the worker receives
a wage which covers the bare necessaries of life, he is underpaid&mdash;he
does not receive the real value of his labour-force. For the value
of any commodity is determined by its socially necessary costs of
production (or in this case, maintenance). &ldquo;Socially necessary&rdquo;
means, further, that no more labour is embodied in a commodity
than is required by applying labour-force, tools, &amp;c., of average or
normal efficiency, and that the commodity is produced in such quantity
as is required to meet the effective demand for it. As this
generally cannot be known in advance, the market value of a commodity
only gravitates round its (abstract) value. But in the long
run an equalization takes place, and for his further deductions Marx
assumes that commodities exchange according to their value.</p>

<p>That part of an industrial capital which is employed for installations,
machines, raw and auxiliary materials, is called by Marx
<i>constant capital</i>, for the value of it or of its wear and tear reappears
in equal proportions in the value of the new product. It is otherwise
with labour. The new value of the product must by necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page810" id="page810"></a>810</span>
be always higher than the value of the employed labour-force.
Hence the capital employed in buying labour-force, <i>i.e.</i> in wages,
is called <i>variable capital</i>. It is the tendency of capitalist production
to reduce the amount spent in wages and to increase the amount
invested in machines, &amp;c. For with natural and social, legal and
other limitations of the working day, and the opposition to unlimited
reduction of wages, it is not possible otherwise to cheapen production
and beat competition. According to the proportion of constant to
variable capital, Marx distinguishes capitals of <i>lowest average</i> and
<i>highest composition</i>, the highest composition being that where
proportionately the least amount of variable (wages) capital is
employed.</p>

<p>The ratio of the wages which workmen receive to the surplus-value
which they produce Marx calls the <i>rate of surplus-value</i>; that
of the surplus-value produced to the whole capital employed is the
<i>rate of profit</i>. It is evident, then, that at the same time the rate
of surplus-value can increase and the rate of profit decrease, and this
in fact is the case. There is a continuous tendency of the rates of
profit to decrease, and only by some counteracting forces is their
decrease temporarily interrupted, protracted, or even sometimes
reversed. Besides, by competition and movement of capitals the
rates of profit in the different branches of trade are pressed towards
an <i>equalization</i> in the shape of an <i>average rate of profits</i>. This average
rate <span class="correction" title="amended from or">of</span> profits, added to the actual cost price of a given commodity,
constitutes its <i>price of production</i>, and it is this price of production
which appears to the empirical mind of the business man as the
value of the commodity. The real law of value, on the contrary,
disappears from the surface in a society where, as to-day, commodities
are bought and sold against money and not exchanged against other
commodities. Nevertheless, according to Marx, it is also to-day this
law of value (&ldquo;labour-value&rdquo;) which in the last resort rules the prices
and profits.</p>

<p>The tendency to cheapen production by increasing the relative
proportion of constant capital&mdash;the fixed capital of the classical
economist plus that portion of the circulating capital which consists
of raw and auxiliary materials, &amp;c.&mdash;leads to a continuous
increase in the size of private enterprises, to their growing concentration.
It is the larger enterprise that beats and swallows the smaller.
The number of dependent workmen&mdash;&ldquo;proletarians&rdquo;&mdash;is thus continually
growing, whilst employment only periodically keeps pace
with their number. Capital alternately attracts and repels workmen,
and creates a constant surplus-population of workmen&mdash;a
<i>reserve-army</i> for its requirements&mdash;which helps to lower wages and
to keep the whole class in economic dependency. A decreasing
number of capitalists usurp and monopolize all the benefits of
industrial progress, whilst the mass of misery, of oppression, of
servitude, of depravation, and of exploitation increases. But at the
same time the working class continuously grows in numbers, and
is disciplined, united and organized by the very mechanism of the
capitalist mode of production. The centralization of the means of
production and the socialization of the mode of production reach
a point where they will become incompatible with their capitalist
integument. Then the knell of capitalist private property will have
been rung. Those who used to expropriate will be expropriated.
Individual property will again be established based upon co-operation
and common ownership of the earth and the means of production
produced by labour.</p>

<p>These are the principal outlines of <i>Das Kapital</i>. Its purely
economic deductions are dominated throughout by the <i>theory of
surplus-value</i>. Its leading sociological principle is the <i>materialist
conception of history</i>. This theory is in <i>Das Kapital</i> only laid down
by implication, but it has been more connectedly explained in the
preface of <i>Zur Kritik</i> and several works of Engels. According to
it the material basis of life, the manner in which life and its requirements
are produced, determines in the last instance the social ideas
and institutions of the time or historical epoch, so that fundamental
changes in the former produce in the long run also fundamental
changes in the latter. A set of social institutions answer to a given
mode of production, and periods where the institutions no longer
answer to the mode of production are periods of social revolution,
which go on until sufficient adjustment has taken place. The main
<i>subjective</i> forces of the struggle between the old order and the new
are <i>the classes</i> into which society is divided after the dissolution of
the communistic or semi-communistic tribes and the creation of
states. And as long as society is divided into classes a class war will
persist, sometimes in a more latent or disguised, sometimes in a more
open or acute form, according to circumstances. In advanced
capitalist society the classes between whom the decisive war takes
place are the capitalist owners of the means of production and the
non-propertied or wage-earning workers, the &ldquo;proletariate.&rdquo; But
the proletariate cannot free itself without freeing all other oppressed
classes, and thus its victory means the end of exploitation and
political repression altogether. Consequently the state as a repressive
power will die out, and a free association will take its place.</p>

<p>Almost from the first <i>Das Kapital</i> and the publications of Marx
and Engels connected with it have been subjected to all kinds of
criticisms. The originality of its leading ideas has been disputed,
the ideas themselves have been declared to be false or only partially
true, and consequently leading to wrong conclusions; and it has been
said of many of Marx&rsquo;s statements that they are incorrect, and that
many of the statistics upon which he bases his deductions do not
prove what he wants them to prove. In regard to the first point,
it must be conceded that the <i>disjecta membra</i> of Marx&rsquo;s value theory
and of his materialist conception of history are already to be found
in the writings of former socialists and sociologists. It may even be
said that just those points of the Marxist doctrine which have become
popular are in a very small degree the produce of Marx&rsquo;s genius,
and that what really belongs to Marx, the methodical conjunction
and elaboration of these points, as well as the finer deductions
drawn from their application, are generally ignored. But this is an
experience repeated over and over again in the history of deductive
sciences, and is quite irrelevant for the question of Marx&rsquo;s place in
the history of socialism and social science.</p>

<p>It must further be admitted that in several places the statistical
evidence upon which Marx bases his deductions is insufficient or
inconclusive. Moreover&mdash;and this is one of the most damaging
admissions&mdash;it repeatedly happens that he points out all the phenomena
connected with a certain question, but afterwards ignores
some of them and proceeds as if they did not exist. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>,
he speaks at the end of the first volume, where he sketches the historical
tendency of capitalist accumulation, of the decreasing number
of magnates of capital as of an established fact. But all statistics
show that the number of capitalists does not decrease, but increase;
and in other places in <i>Das Kapital</i> this fact is indeed fully admitted,
and even accentuated. Marx was, as the third volume shows, also
quite aware that limited liability companies play an important part
in the distribution of wealth. But he leaves this factor, too, quite
out of sight, and confuses the concentration of private enterprises
with the centralization of fortunes and capitals. By these and other
omissions, quite apart from developments he could not well foresee,
he announces a coming evolution which is very unlikely to take place
in the way described.</p>

<p>In this and in other features of his work a <i>dualism</i> reveals itself
which is also often observable in his actions in life&mdash;the alternating
predominance of the spirit of the scholar and the spirit of the radical
revolutionary. Marx originally entitled his great social work <i>Criticism
of Political Economy</i>, and this is still the sub-title of <i>Das Kapital</i>.
But the conception of <i>critic</i> or <i>criticize</i> has with Marx a very pronounced
meaning. He uses them mostly as identical with fundamentally
opposing. Much as he had mocked the &ldquo;critical criticism&rdquo;
of the Bauers, he is in this respect yet of their breed and relapses
into their habits. He retained in principle the Hegelian dialectical
method, of which he said that in order to be rationally employed
it must be &ldquo;turned upside down,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> put upon a materialist basis.
But as a matter of fact he has in many respects contravened against
this prescription. Strict materialist dialectics cannot conclude much
beyond actual facts. Dialectical materialism is revolutionary in
the sense that it recognizes no finality, but otherwise it is necessarily
positivist in the general meaning of that term. But Marx&rsquo;s opposition
to modern society was fundamental and revolutionary, answering
to that of the proletarian to the <i>bourgeois</i>. And here we come to
the main and fatal contradiction of his work. He wanted to proceed,
and to a very great extent did proceed, scientifically. Nothing
was to be deduced from preconceived ideas; from the observed
evolutionary laws and forces of modern society alone were conclusions
to be drawn. And yet the final conclusion of the work, as
already noted, is a preconceived idea; it is the announcement of a
state of society logically opposed to the given one. Imperceptibly
the dialectical movement of <i>ideas</i> is substituted for the dialectical
movement of facts, and the real movement of facts is only considered
so far as is compatible with the former. Science is violated in the
service of speculation. The picture given at the end of the first
volume answers to a conception arrived at by speculative socialism
in the &rsquo;forties. True, Marx calls this chapter &ldquo;the historical
tendency of capitalist accumulation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tendency&rdquo; does not
necessarily mean realization in every detail. But on the whole the
language used there is much too absolute to allow of the interpretation
that Marx only wanted to give a speculative picture of the goal to
which capitalist accumulation would lead if unhampered by socialist
counteraction. The epithet &ldquo;historical&rdquo; indicates rather that the
passage in question was meant to give in the main the true outline
of the forthcoming social revolution. We are led to this conclusion
also by the fact that, in language which is not in the least conditional,
it is there said that the change of capitalist property into social
property will mean &ldquo;only the expropriation of a few usurpers by the
mass of the people.&rdquo; In short, the principal reason for the undeniable
contradictions in <i>Das Kapital</i> is to be found in the fact that where
Marx has to do with details or subordinate subjects he mostly notices
the important changes which actual evolution had brought about
since the time of his first socialist writings, and thus himself states
how far their presuppositions have been corrected by facts. But
when he comes to general conclusions, he adheres in the main to the
original propositions based upon the old uncorrected presuppositions.
Besides, the complex character of modern society is greatly under-estimated,
so that, <i>e.g.</i>, such important features as the influence
of the changes of traffic and aggregation on modern life are scarcely
considered at all; and industrial and political problems are viewed
only from the aspect of class antagonism, and never under their
administrative aspect. With regard to the theory of surplus-value
and its foundation, the theory of labour-value, so much may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page811" id="page811"></a>811</span>
safely said that, its premisses accepted, it is most ingeniously and
most consistently worked out. And since its principal contention
is in any case so far true that the wage-earning workers as a whole
produce more than they receive, the theory has the great merit
of demonstrating in an admirably lucid way the relations between
wages and surplus-produce and the growth and movements of capital.
But the theory of labour-value as the determining factor of the
exchange or market value of commodities can with justification be
disputed, and is surely not more true than those theories of value
based on social demand or utility. Marx himself, in placing in the
third volume what he calls the <i>law of value</i> in the background and
setting out the formation of the &ldquo;price of production&rdquo; as the
empirical determinator of prices in modern society, justifies those who
look upon the conception of labour-value as an abstract formula
which does not apply to individual exchanges of commodities at
all, but which only serves to show an imagined typical example
of what in reality to-day is only true with regard to the production
of the whole of social wealth. Thus understood, the conception of
labour-value is quite unobjectionable, but it loses much of the significance
attributed to it by most of the disciples of Marx and occasionally
by Marx himself. It is a means of analysing and exemplifying surplus
labour, but quite inconclusive as to the proof of the surplus
value, or as an indication of the degree of the exploitation of the
workers. This becomes the more apparent the more the reader
advances in the second and third volumes of <i>Das Kapital</i>, where
commercial capital, money capital and ground rent are dealt with.
Though full of fine observations and deductions, they form, from a
revolutionary standpoint, an anti-climax to the first volume. It is
difficult to see how, after all that is explained there on the functions
of the classes that stand between industrial employers and workers,
Marx could have returned to those sweeping conclusions with which
the first volume ends.</p>

<p>The great scientific achievement of Marx lies, then, not in these
conclusions, but in the <i>details</i> and yet more in the <i>method</i> and <i>principles</i>
of his investigations in his <i>philosophy of history</i>. Here he has,
as is now generally admitted, broken new ground and opened new
ways and new outlooks. Nobody before him had so clearly shown
the rôle of the productive agencies in historical evolution; nobody
so masterfully exhibited their great determining influence on the
forms and ideologies of social organisms. The passages and chapters
dealing with this subject form, notwithstanding occasional exaggerations,
the crowning parts of his works. If he has been justly compared
with Darwin, it is in these respects that he ranks with that great
genius, not through his value theory, ingenious though it be. With
the great theorist of biological transformation he had also in common
the indefatigable way in which he made painstaking studies of the
minutest details connected with his researches. In the same year
as Darwin&rsquo;s epoch-making work on the origin of species there
appeared also Marx&rsquo;s work <i>Zur Kritik der politischen Ökonomie</i>,
where he explains in concise sentences in the preface that philosophy
of history which has for the theory of the transformation or evolution
of social organisms the same significance that the argument of
Darwin had for the theory of the transformation of biological
organisms.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span><a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (<span class="grk" title="Maria, Mariam">&#924;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#945;, &#924;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#940;&#956;</span>), the mother of Jesus. At the
time when the gospel history begins, she had her home in Galilee,
at the village of Nazareth. Of her parentage nothing is recorded
in any extant historical document of the 1st century, for the
genealogy in Luke iii. (cf. i. 27) is manifestly that of Joseph.
In early life she became the wife of Joseph (<i>q.v.</i>) and the mother
of Jesus Christ; that she afterwards had other children is a
natural inference from Matt. i. 25, which the evangelists, who
frequently allude to &ldquo;the brethren of the Lord,&rdquo; are at no
pains to obviate. The few incidents mentioned in Scripture
regarding her show that she followed our Lord to the very close
of His earthly career with unfailing motherliness, but the
&ldquo;Magnificat&rdquo; assigned to her in Luke i. is the only passage
which would distinctly imply on her part a high prophetic
appreciation of His divine mission. It is however doubtful
whether Luke really intended to assign this hymn to Mary
or to Elizabeth (cf. especially <i>Niceta of Remesiana</i> by A. E. Burn,
Cambridge, 1905; Harnack&rsquo;s &ldquo;Das Magnificat der Elizabeth&rdquo;
in the <i>Sitzungsberichte</i> of the Berlin Academy for 1900, and
Burkitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Who spoke the Magnificat?&rdquo; in the <i>Journal of
Theological Studies</i>, Jan. 1906). The original text of Luke
probably mentioned no name in introducing the Magnificat;
scribes supplied the ambiguity by inserting, some Mary, others
Elizabeth. It is doubtful which represents the intention of
the writer: there is perhaps more to be said for the view that
he meant to assign the Magnificat to Elizabeth. Mary was
present at the Crucifixion, where she was commended by Jesus
to the care of the apostle John (John xix. 26, 27), Joseph having
apparently died before this time. Mary is mentioned in Acts i.
14 as having been among those who continued in prayer along
with the apostles at Jerusalem during the interval between
the Ascension and Pentecost. There is no allusion in the New
Testament to the time or place of her death.</p>

<p>The subsequent growth of ecclesiastical tradition and belief
regarding Mary will be traced must conveniently under the separate
heads of (1) her perpetual virginity, (2) her absolute sinlessness,
(3) her peculiar relation to the Godhead, which specially
fits her for successful intercession on behalf of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Her Perpetual Virginity.</i>&mdash;This doctrine was, to say the
least, of no importance in the eyes of the evangelists, and so
far as extant writings go there is no evidence of its having been
anywhere taught within the pale of the Catholic Church of the
first three centuries. On the contrary, to Tertullian the fact of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page812" id="page812"></a>812</span>
Mary&rsquo;s marriage after the birth of Christ is a useful argument
for the reality of the Incarnation against gnostic notions,
and Origen relies upon the references to the Lord&rsquo;s brethren
as disproving the Docetism with which he had to contend.
The <span class="grk" title="aeiparthenia">&#7936;&#949;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span> though very ancient, is in reality a doctrine
of non-Catholic origin, and first occurs in a work proscribed
by the earliest papal <i>Index librorum prohibitorum</i> (attributed
to Gelasius) as heretical,&mdash;the so-called <i>Protevangelium Jacobi</i>,
written, it is generally admitted, within the 2nd century. According
to this very early source, which seems to have formed
the basis of the later <i>Liber de infantia Mariae et Christi salvatoris</i>
and <i>Evangelium de nativitate Mariae</i>, the name of Mary&rsquo;s
father was Joachim (in the <i>Liber de infantia</i> a shepherd of the
tribe of Judah, living in Jerusalem); he had long been married
to Anna her mother, whose continual childlessness had become
a cause of much humiliation and sorrow to them both. The
birth of a daughter was at last angelically predicted to each
parent separately. From her third to her twelfth year &ldquo;Mary
was in the Temple as if she were a dove that dwelt there, and
she received food from the hand of an angel.&rdquo; When she
became of nubile age a guardian was sought for her by the
priests among the widowers of Israel &ldquo;lest she should defile
the sanctuary of the Lord&rdquo;; and Joseph, an elderly man with
a family, was indicated for this charge by a miraculous token.
Some time afterwards the annunciation took place; when the
Virgin&rsquo;s pregnancy was discovered, Joseph and she were brought
before the high priest, and, though asserting their innocence
in all sincerity, were acquitted only after they had been tried
with &ldquo;the water of the ordeal of the Lord&rdquo; (Num. v. 11).
Numerous details regarding the birth at Bethlehem are then
given. The perpetual physical virginity of Mary, naïvely
insisted upon in this apocryphon, is alluded to only with a half
belief and a &ldquo;some say&rdquo; by Clement of Alexandria (<i>Strom.</i>
vii. 16), but became of much importance to the leaders of the
Church in the 4th century, as for example to Ambrose, who sees
in Ezek. xliv. 1-3 a prophetic indication of so great a mystery.<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Those who continued to believe that Mary, after the miraculous
birth of Jesus, had become the mother of other children by
Joseph came accordingly to be spoken of as her enemies&mdash;Antidicomarianitae
(Epiphanius) or Antidicomaritae (Augustine)&mdash;and
the first-mentioned author devotes a whole chapter
(ch. 78) of his great work upon heresies to their confutation.
For holding the same view Bonosus of Sardica was condemned
by the synod of Capua in 391. To Jerome the perpetual virginity
not only of Mary but even of Joseph appeared of so much
consequence that while a young man he wrote (387) the long
and vehement tract <i>Against Helvidius</i>, in which he was the
first to broach the theory (which has since gained wide currency)
that the brethren of our Lord were children neither of Mary
by her husband nor of Joseph by a former marriage, but of
another Mary, sister to the Virgin and wife of Clopas or Alphaeus.
At last the epithet of <span class="grk" title="haei parthenos">&#7936;&#949;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> was authoritatively applied
to the Virgin by the council of Chalcedon in 451, and the
doctrine implied has ever since been an undisputed point of
orthodoxy both in the Eastern and in the Roman Churches,
some even seeking to hold the Anglican Church committed to it
on account of the general declaration (in the <i>Homilies</i>) of concurrence
in the decisions of the first four general councils.</p>

<p><i>Her Absolute Sinlessness</i>.&mdash;While much of the apocryphal
literature of the early sects in which she is repeatedly spoken
of as &ldquo;undefiled before God&rdquo; would seem to encourage some
such doctrine as this, many passages from the acknowledged
fathers of the Church could be cited to show that it was originally
quite unknown to Catholicism. Even Augustine repeatedly
asserts that she was born in original sin (<i>De gen. ad lit.</i> x. 18);
and the <i>locus classicus</i> regarding her possible immunity from
actual transgression, on which the subsequent doctrine of
Lombardus and his commentators was based, is simply an
extremely guarded passage (<i>De nat. et grat.</i> ch. 36), in which,
while contradicting the assertion of Pelagius that many had
lived free from sin, he wishes exception to be made in favour
of &ldquo;the holy Virgin Mary, of whom out of honour to the Lord
I wish no question to be made where sins are treated of&mdash;for
how do we know what mode of grace wholly to conquer
sin may have been bestowed upon her who was found meet
to conceive and bear Him of whom it is certain that He had
no sin.&rdquo; A writer so late as Anselm (<i>Cur deus homo</i>, ii. 16),
declares that &ldquo;the Virgin herself whence He (Christ) was assumed
was conceived in iniquity, and in sin did her mother conceive
her, and with original sin was she born, because she too sinned
in Adam in whom all sinned,&rdquo; and the same view was expressed
by Damiani. For the growth of the modern Roman doctrine
of the immaculate conception from the time in the 12th century,
when the canons of Lyons sought to institute a festival in
honour of her &ldquo;holy conception,&rdquo; and were remonstrated with
by Bernard, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Immaculate Conception</a></span>. The epithets applied
to her in the Greek Church are such as <span class="grk" title="amolyntos, panagnos,
hagia, panagia">&#7936;&#956;&#972;&#955;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;, &#960;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#7936;&#947;&#943;&#945;, &#960;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>; but in the East generally no clear distinction
is drawn between immunity from actual sin and original
sinlessness.</p>

<p><i>Her Peculiar Relation to the Godhead, which specially fits
Her for Successful Intercession on Behalf of Mankind.</i>&mdash;It seems
probable that the epithet <span class="grk" title="theotokos">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#964;&#972;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;Mother of God&rdquo;) was
first applied to Mary by theologians of Alexandria towards
the close of the 3rd century; but it does not occur in any
genuine extant writing of that period, unless we are to assign
an early date to the apocryphal <i>Transitus Mariae</i>, in which
the word is of frequent occurrence. In the 4th century it is
met with frequently, being used by Eusebius, Athanasius,
Didymus and Gregory of Nazianzus,&mdash;the latter declaring
that the man who believes not Mary to have been <span class="grk" title="theotokos">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#964;&#972;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span> has
no part in God (<i>Orat.</i> li. p. 738).<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> If its use was first recommended
by a desire to bring into prominence the divinity of
the Incarnate Word, there can be no doubt that latterly the
expression came to be valued as directly honourable to Mary
herself and as corresponding to the greatly increased esteem
in which she personally was held throughout the Catholic world,
so that when Nestorius and others began to dispute its propriety,
in the following century, their temerity was resented, not as
an attack upon the established orthodox doctrine of the Nicene
creed, but as threatening a more vulnerable and more tender
part of the popular faith. It is sufficient in illustration of the
drift of theological opinion to refer to the first sermon of Proclus,
preached on a certain festival of the Virgin (<span class="grk" title="panêgyris parthenikê">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#942;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span>)
at Constantinople about the year 430 or to that of Cyril of
Alexandria delivered in the church of the Virgin Mary at the
opening of the council of Ephesus in 431. In the former
the orator speaks of &ldquo;the holy Virgin and Mother of God&rdquo; as
&ldquo;the spotless treasure-house of virginity, the spiritual paradise
of the second Adam; the workshop in which two natures
were welded together ... the one bridge between God
and men&rdquo;;<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a> in the latter she is saluted as the &ldquo;mother and
virgin,&rdquo; &ldquo;through whom (<span class="grk" title="di' hês">&#948;&#953;&#8125; &#7975;&#962;</span>) the Trinity is glorified and
worshipped, the cross of the Saviour exalted and honoured,
through whom heaven triumphs, the angels are made glad,
devils driven forth, the tempter overcome, and the fallen creature
raised up even to heaven.&rdquo; The response which such language
found in the popular heart was sufficiently shown by the shouts
of joy with which the Ephesian mob heard of the deposition
of Nestorius, escorting his judges with torches and incense
to their homes, and celebrating the occasion by a general illumination.
The causes which in the preceding century had
led to this exaltation of the Mother of God in the esteem of
the Catholic world are not far to seek. On the one hand the
solution of the Arian controversy, however correct it may
have been theoretically, undoubtedly had the practical effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page813" id="page813"></a>813</span>
of relegating the God-man redeemer for ordinary minds into
a far away region of &ldquo;remote and awful Godhead,&rdquo; so that
the need for a mediator to deal with the very Mediator could
not fail to be felt. On the other hand, the religious instincts of
mankind are very ready to pay worship, in grosser or more
refined forms, to the idea of womanhood; at all events many
of those who became professing Christians at the political fall
of Paganism entered the Church with such instincts (derived
from the nature-religions in which they had been brought up)
very fully developed. Probably it ought to be added that the
comparative colourlessness with which the character of Mary
is presented, not only in the canonical gospels but even in the
most copious of the apocrypha, left greater scope for the untrammelled
exercise of devout imagination than was possible
in the case of Christ, in the circumstances of whose humiliation
and in whose recorded utterances there were many things
which the religious consciousness found difficulty in understanding
or in adapting to itself. At all events, from the time
of the council of Ephesus, to exhibit figures of the Virgin and
Child became the approved expression of orthodoxy, and the
relationship of motherhood in which Mary had been formally
declared to stand to God<a name="fa5m" id="fa5m" href="#ft5m"><span class="sp">5</span></a> was instinctively felt to give the
fullest and freest sanction of the Church to that invocation of
her aid which had previously been resorted to only hesitatingly
and occasionally. Previously to the council of Ephesus, indeed,
the practice had obtained complete recognition, so far as we
know, in those circles only in which one or other of the numerous
redactions of the <i>Transitus Mariae</i> passed current.<a name="fa6m" id="fa6m" href="#ft6m"><span class="sp">6</span></a> There
we read of Mary&rsquo;s prayer to Christ: &ldquo;Do Thou bestow Thine
aid upon every man calling upon, or praying to, or naming
the name of Thine handmaid&rdquo;; to which His answer is, &ldquo;Every
soul that calls upon Thy name shall not be ashamed, but shall
find mercy and support and confidence both in the world that
now is and in that which is to come in the presence of My Father
in the heavens.&rdquo; But Gregory of Nazianzus also, in his panegyric
upon Justina, mentions with incidental approval that
in her hour of peril she &ldquo;implored Mary the Virgin to come
to the aid of a virgin in her danger.&rdquo;<a name="fa7m" id="fa7m" href="#ft7m"><span class="sp">7</span></a> Of the growth of the
Marian cultus, alike in the East and in the West, after the
decision at Ephesus it would be impossible to trace the history,
however slightly, within the limits of the present article. Justinian
in one of his laws bespeaks her advocacy for the empire, and
he inscribes the high altar in the new church of St Sophia
with her name. Narses looks to her for directions on the field
of battle. The emperor Heraclius bears her image on his
banner. John of Damascus speaks of her as the sovereign
lady to whom the whole creation has been made subject by
her son. Peter Damian recognizes her as the most exalted
of all creatures, and apostrophizes her as deified and endowed
with all power in heaven and in earth, yet not forgetful of our
race.<a name="fa8m" id="fa8m" href="#ft8m"><span class="sp">8</span></a> In a word, popular devotion gradually developed the
entire system of doctrine and practice which Protestant controversialists
are accustomed to call by the name of Mariolatry.
With reference to this much-disputed phrase it is always to
be kept in mind that the directly authoritative documents,
alike of the Greek and of the Roman Church, distinguish formally
between <i>latria</i> and <i>dulia</i>, and declare that the &ldquo;worship&rdquo; to be
paid to the mother of God must never exceed that superlative
degree of <i>dulia</i> which is vaguely described as <i>hyperdulia</i>. But
the comparative reserve shown by the council of Trent in its
decrees, and even in its catechism,<a name="fa9m" id="fa9m" href="#ft9m"><span class="sp">9</span></a> on this subject has not
been observed by individual theologians, and in view of the
fact of the canonization of some of these (such as Liguori)&mdash;a
fact guaranteeing the absence of erroneous teaching from
their writings&mdash;it does not seem unfair, to hold the Roman
Church responsible for the natural interpretations and just
inferences which may be drawn even from apparently exaggerated
expressions in such works as the well-known <i>Glories of
Mary</i> and others frequently quoted in controversial literature.
There is a good <i>résumé</i> of Catholic developments of the cultus
of Mary in Pusey&rsquo;s <i>Eirenicon</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following are the principal feasts of the Virgin in the order
in which they occur in the ecclesiastical year. (1) That of the
Presentation (<i>Praesentatio B. V. M.</i>, <span class="grk" title="ta eisodia tês theotokou">&#964;&#8048; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#972;&#948;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#964;&#972;&#954;&#959;&#965;</span>), to commemorate
the beginning of her stay in the Temple, as recorded in
the <i>Protevangelium Jacobi</i>. It is believed to have originated in the
East in the 8th century, the earliest allusion to it being made by
George of Nicomedia (9th century); Manuel Comnenus made it
universal for the Eastern Empire, and in the modern Greek Church
it is one of the five great festivals in honour of the Deipara. It was
introduced into the Western Church late in the 14th century, and,
after having been withdrawn from the calendar by Pius V., was
restored by Sixtus V., the day observed in both East and West
being the 21st of November. It is not mentioned in the English
calendar. (2) The Feast of the Conception (<i>Conceptio B. V. M.</i>,
<i>Conceptio immaculata B. V. M.</i>, <span class="grk" title="sullêpsis tês hagias Hannês">&#963;&#973;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#7948;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span>), observed
by the Roman Catholic Church on the 8th of December, and by
all the Eastern Churches on the 9th of December, has already been
explained; in the Greek Church it only ranks as one of the middle
festivals of Mary. (3) The Feast of the Purification (<i>Occursus</i>,
<i>Obviatio</i>, <i>Praesentatio</i>, <i>Festum SS Simeonis et Annae</i>, <i>Purificatio</i>,
<i>Candelaria</i>, <span class="grk" title="hupapantê">&#8017;&#960;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#942;</span>, <span class="grk" title="hupantê">&#8017;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#942;</span>) is otherwise known as <span class="sc">Candlemas</span>.
(4) The Feast of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary (<i>Annunciatio</i>,
<span class="grk" title="Euaggelismos">&#917;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>). It may be mentioned that at the council of Toledo
in 656 it was decreed that this festival should be observed on the
18th of December, in order to keep clear of Lent. (5) The Feast
of the Visitation (<i>Visitatio B. V. M.</i>) was instituted by Urban VI.,
promulgated in 1389 by Boniface IX., and reappointed by the
council of Basel in 1441 in commemoration of the visit paid
by Mary to Elizabeth. It is observed on the 2nd of July, and has
been retained in the English calendar. (6) The Feast of the Assumption
(<i>Dormitio</i>, <i>Pausatio</i>, <i>Transitus</i>, <i>Depositio</i>, <i>Migratio</i>, <i>Assumptio</i>,
<span class="grk" title="kaimêsis">&#954;&#945;&#943;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="metastasis">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="analêpsis">&#7936;&#957;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;</span>) has reference to the apocryphal story
related in several forms in various documents of the 4th century
condemned by Pope Gelasius. Their general purport is that as the
time drew nigh for &ldquo;the most blessed Virgin&rdquo; (who is also spoken of
as &ldquo;Holy Mary,&rdquo; &ldquo;the queen of all the saints,&rdquo; &ldquo;the holy spotless
Mother of God&rdquo;) to leave the world, the apostles were miraculously
assembled round her deathbed at Bethlehem on the Lord&rsquo;s Day,
whereupon Christ descended with a multitude of angels and
received her soul. After &ldquo;the spotless and precious body&rdquo; had
been laid in the tomb, &ldquo;suddenly there shone round them (the
apostles) a miraculous light,&rdquo; and it was taken up into heaven. The
first Catholic writer who relates this story is Gregory of Tours
(<i>c.</i> 590); Epiphanius two centuries earlier had declared that nothing
was known as to the circumstances of Mary&rsquo;s death and burial; and
one of the documents of the council of Ephesus implies a belief that
she was buried in that city. The Sleep of the Theotokos is
observed in the Greek Church as a great festival on the 15th of
August; the Armenian Church also commemorates it, but the
Ethiopic Church celebrates her death and burial on two separate
days. The earliest allusion to the existence of such a festival in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page814" id="page814"></a>814</span>
the Western Church seems to be that found in the proceedings of
the synod of Salzburg in 800; it is also spoken of in the thirty-sixth
canon of the reforming synod of Mainz, held in 813. It was not
at that time universal, being mentioned as doubtful in the capitularies
of Charlemagne. The doctrine of the bodily assumption of the
Virgin into heaven, although extensively believed, and indeed flowing
as a natural theological consequence from that of her sinlessness, has
never been declared to be &ldquo;de fide&rdquo; by the Church of Rome, and is
still merely a &ldquo;pia sententia.&rdquo; (7) The Nativity of Mary (<i>Nativitas</i>,

in one of the homilies of Andrew of Crete (<i>c.</i> 750), and with
the Feasts of the Purification, the Annunciation and the Assumption,
it was appointed to be observed by the synod of Salzburg in 800, but
seems to have been unknown at that time in the Gallican Church,
and even two centuries later it was by no means general in Italy.
In the Roman Catholic Church a large number of minor festivals in
honour of the Virgin are locally celebrated; and all the Saturdays
of the year as well as the entire month of May are also regarded
as sacred to her.</p>

&ldquo;as the human race fell into bondage to death by a virgin, so is it

seven demons were cast out of her, but this need not imply

empty and of her interview with the risen Jesus. Mary of

<p><span class="bold">MARY I.,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> queen of England (1516-1558), unpleasantly remembered
as &ldquo;the Bloody Mary&rdquo; on account of the religious
persecutions which prevailed during her reign, was the daughter
of Henry VIII. and Catherine of Aragon, born in the earlier
years of their married life, when as yet no cloud had darkened
the prospect of Henry&rsquo;s reign. Her birth occurred at Greenwich,
on Monday, the 18th February 1516, and she was baptized on
the following Wednesday, Cardinal Wolsey standing as her
godfather. She seems to have been a singularly precocious
child, and is reported in July 1520, when scarcely four and a
half years old, as entertaining some visitors by a performance on
the virginals. When she was little over nine she was addressed
in a complimentary Latin oration by commissioners sent over
from Flanders on commercial matters, and replied to them in
the same language &ldquo;with as much assurance and facility as if
she had been twelve years old&rdquo; (Gayangos, iii. pt. 1, 82). Her
father was proud of her achievements. About the same time
that she replied to the commissioners in Latin he was arranging
that she should learn Spanish, Italian and French. A great
part, however, of the credit of her early education was undoubtedly
due to her mother, who not only consulted the
Spanish scholar Vives upon the subject, but was herself Mary&rsquo;s
first teacher in Latin. She was also well instructed in music,
and among her principal recreations as she grew up was that
of playing on the virginals and lute.</p>

<p>It was a misfortune that she shared with high-born ladies
generally in those days that her prospects in life were made
a matter of sordid bargaining from the first. Mary was little
more than two years old when she was proposed in marriage
to the dauphin, son of Francis I. Three years afterwards the
French alliance was broken off, and in 1522 she was affianced
to her cousin the young emperor Charles V. by the Treaty of
Windsor. No one, perhaps, seriously expected either of these
arrangements to endure; and, though we read in grave state
papers of some curious compliments and love tokens (really
the mere counters of diplomacy) professedly sent by the girl
of nine to her powerful cousin, not many years passed away
before Charles released himself from this engagement and made
a more convenient match. In 1526 a rearrangement was made
of the royal household, and it was thought right to give Mary
an establishment of her own along with a council on the borders
of Wales, for the better government of the Marches. For
some years she accordingly kept her court at Ludlow, while
new arrangements were made for the disposal of her hand.
She was now proposed as a wife, not for the dauphin as before,
but for his father Francis I., who had just been redeemed from
captivity at Madrid, and who was only too glad of an alliance
with England to mitigate the severe conditions imposed on
him by the emperor. Wolsey, however, on this occasion,
only made use of the princess as a bait to enhance the terms
of the compact, and left Francis free in the end to marry the
emperor&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>It was during this negotiation, as Henry afterwards pretended,
that the question was first raised whether Henry&rsquo;s
own marriage with Catherine was a lawful one. Grammont,
bishop of Tarbes, who was one of the ambassadors sent over
by Francis to ask the princess in marriage, had, it was said,
started an objection that she might possibly be considered
illegitimate on account of her mother having been once the wife
of her father&rsquo;s brother. The statement was a mere pretence
to shield the king when the unpopularity of the divorce became
apparent. It is proved to be untrue by the strongest evidence,
for we have pretty full contemporary records of the whole
negotiation. On the contrary, it is quite clear that Henry, who
had already for some time conceived the project of a divorce,
kept the matter a dead secret, and was particularly anxious that
the French ambassadors should not know it, while he used his
daughter&rsquo;s hand as a bait for a new alliance. The alliance
itself, however, was actually concluded by a treaty dated Westminster,
the 30th of April 1527, in which it was provided, as
regards the Princess Mary, that she should be married either
to Francis himself or to his second son Henry duke of Orleans.
But the real object was only to lay the foundation of a perfect
mutual understanding between the two kings, which Wolsey
soon after went into France to confirm.</p>

<p>During the next nine years the life of Mary, as well as
that of her mother, was rendered miserable by the conduct of
Henry VIII. in seeking a divorce. During most of that period
mother and daughter seem to have been kept apart. Possibly
Queen Catherine had the harder trial; but Mary&rsquo;s was scarcely
less severe. Removed from court and treated as a bastard, she
was, on the birth of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s daughter, required to give
up the dignity of princess and acknowledge the illegitimacy
of her own birth. On her refusal her household was broken
up, and she was sent to Hatfield to act as lady-in-waiting to
her own infant half-sister. Nor was even this the worst of
her trials; her very life was in danger from the hatred of Anne
Boleyn. Her health, moreover, was indifferent, and even when
she was seriously ill, although Henry sent his own physician,
Dr Buttes, to attend her, he declined to let her mother visit
her. So also at her mother&rsquo;s death, in January 1536, she was
forbidden to take a last farewell of her. But in May following
another change occurred. Anne Boleyn, the real cause of all
her miseries, fell under the king&rsquo;s displeasure and was put to
death. Mary was then urged to make a humble submission
to her father as the means of recovering his favour, and after a
good deal of correspondence with the king&rsquo;s secretary, Cromwell,
she actually did so. The terms exacted of her were bitter
in the extreme, but there was no chance of making life tolerable
otherwise, if indeed she was permitted to live at all; and the
poor friendless girl, absolutely at the mercy of a father who
could brook no contradiction, at length subscribed an act of
submission, acknowledging the king as &ldquo;Supreme Head of
the Church of England under Christ,&rdquo; repudiating the pope&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page815" id="page815"></a>815</span>
authority, and confessing that the marriage between her father
and mother &ldquo;was by God&rsquo;s law and man&rsquo;s law incestuous and
unlawful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No act, perhaps, in the whole of Henry&rsquo;s reign gives us a
more painful idea of his revolting despotism. Mary was a
high-spirited girl, and undoubtedly popular. All Europe
looked upon her at that time as the only legitimate child of
her father, but her father himself compelled her to disown
the title and pass an unjust stigma on her own birth and her
mother&rsquo;s good name. Nevertheless Henry was now reconciled
to her, and gave her a household in some degree suitable to
her rank. During the rest of the reign we hear little about
her except in connexion with a number of new marriage projects
taken up and abandoned successively, one of which, to the
count palatine Philip, duke of Bavaria, was specially repugnant
to her in the matter of religion. Her privy purse expenses
for nearly the whole of this period have been published, and
show that Hatfield, Beaulieu or Newhall in Essex, Richmond
and Hunsdon were among her principal places of residence.
Although she was still treated as of illegitimate birth, it was
believed that the king, having obtained from parliament the
extraordinary power to dispose of the crown by will, would
restore her to her place in the succession, and three years before
his death she was so restored by statute, but still under conditions
to be regulated by her father&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p>Under the reign of her brother, Edward VI. she was again
subjected to severe trials, which at one time made her seriously
meditate taking flight and escaping abroad. Edward himself
indeed seems to have been personally not unkind to her, but
the religious revolution in his reign assumed proportions such
as it had not done before, and Mary, who had done sufficient
violence to her own convictions in submitting to a despotic
father, was not disposed to yield an equally tame obedience
to authority exercised by a factious council in the name of a
younger brother not yet come to years of discretion. Besides,
the cause of the pope was naturally her own. In spite of the
forced declaration formerly wrung from herself, no one really
regarded her as a bastard, and the full recognition of her rights
depended on the recognition of the pope as head of the Church.
Hence, when Edward&rsquo;s parliament passed an Act of Uniformity
enjoining services in English and communion in both kinds,
the law appeared to her totally void of authority, and she
insisted on having Mass in her own private chapel under the
old form. When ordered to desist, she appealed for protection
to the emperor Charles V., who, being her cousin, intervened
for some time not ineffectually, threatening war with England
if her religious liberty was interfered with. But Edward&rsquo;s
court was composed of factions of which the most violent
eventually carried the day. Lord Seymour, the admiral,
was attainted of treason and beheaded in 1549. His brother,
the Protector Somerset, met with the same fate in 1552. Dudley,
duke of Northumberland, then became paramount in the privy
council, and easily obtained the sanction of the young king
to those schemes for altering the succession which led immediately
after his death to the usurpation of Lady Jane Grey.
Dudley had, in fact, overawed all the rest of the privy council,
and when the event occurred he took such energetic measures
to give effect to the scheme that Lady Jane was actually recognized
as queen for some days, and Mary had even to fly from
Hunsdon into Norfolk. But the country was really devoted
to her cause, as indeed her right in law was unquestionable,
and before many days she was royally received in London,
and took up her abode within the Tower.</p>

<p>Her first acts at the beginning of her reign displayed a character
very different from that which she still holds in popular
estimation. Her clemency towards those who had taken up
arms against her was altogether remarkable. She released
from prison Lady Jane&rsquo;s father, Suffolk, and had difficulty
even in signing the warrant for the execution of Northumberland.
Lady Jane herself she fully meant to spare, and did spare till
after Wyatt&rsquo;s formidable insurrection. Her conduct, indeed,
was in every respect conciliatory and pacific, and so far as they
depended on her personal character the prospects of the new
reign might have appeared altogether favourable. But unfortunately
her position was one of peculiar difficulty, and the
policy on which she determined was far from judicious. Inexperienced
in the art of governing, she had no trusty councillor
but Gardiner; every other member of the council had been
more or less implicated in the conspiracy against her. And
though she valued Gardiner&rsquo;s advice she was naturally led to
rely even more on that of her cousin, the emperor, who had
been her mother&rsquo;s friend in adversity, and had done such material
service to herself in the preceding reign. Following the emperor&rsquo;s
guidance she determined almost from the first to make his son
Philip her husband, though she was eleven years his senior.
She was also strongly desirous of restoring the old religion
and wiping out the stigma of illegitimacy upon her birth, so
that she might not seem to reign by virtue of a mere parliamentary
settlement.</p>

<p>Each of these different objects was attended by difficulties
or objections peculiar to itself; but the marriage was the most
unpopular of all. A restoration of the old religion threatened
to deprive the new owners of abbey lands of their easy and
comfortable acquisitions; and it was only with an express
reservation of their interests that the thing was actually accomplished.
A declaration of her own legitimacy necessarily cast
a slur on that of her sister Elizabeth, and cut her off from the
succession. But the marriage promised to throw England into
the arms of Spain and place the resources of the kingdom at
the command of the emperor&rsquo;s son. The Commons sent her
a deputation to entreat that she would not marry a foreigner,
and when her resolution was known insurrections broke out
in different parts of the country. Suffolk, whose first rebellion
had been pardoned, proclaimed Lady Jane Grey again in
Leicestershire, while young Wyatt raised the county of Kent
and, though denied access by London Bridge, led his men round
by Kingston to the very gates of London before he was repulsed.
In the midst of the danger Mary showed great intrepidity,
and the rebellion was presently quelled; after which, unhappily,
she got leave to pursue her own course unchecked. She married
Philip, restored the old religion, and got Cardinal Pole to come
over and absolve the kingdom from its past disobedience to
the Holy See.</p>

<p>It was a more than questionable policy thus to ally England
with Spain&mdash;a power then actually at war with France. By
the treaty, indeed, England was to remain neutral; but the force
of events, in the end, compelled her, as might have been expected,
to take part in the quarrel. Meanwhile the country was full
of faction, and seditious pamphlets of Protestant origin inflamed
the people with hatred against the Spaniards. Philip&rsquo;s Spanish
followers met with positive ill-usage everywhere, and violent
outbreaks occurred. A year after his marriage Philip went
over to Brussels to receive from his father the government
of the Low Countries and afterwards the kingdom of Spain.
Much to Mary&rsquo;s distress, his absence was prolonged for a year
and a half, and when he returned in March 1557 it was only
to commit England completely to the war; after which he went
back to Brussels in July, to return no more to England.</p>

<p>Hostilities with France were inevitable, because France
had encouraged disaffection among Mary&rsquo;s subjects, even
during the brief truce of Vaucelles. Conspiracies had been
hatched by English refugees in Paris, and an attempt to seize
Scarborough had been made with the aid of vessels from the
Seine. But perhaps the strangest thing about the situation
was that the pope took part with France against Spain; and
so the very marriage which Mary had contracted to bring
England back to the Holy See made her the wife of the pope&rsquo;s
enemy. It was, moreover, this war with France that occasioned
the final calamity of the loss of Calais, which sank so deeply
into Mary&rsquo;s heart some time before she died.</p>

<p>The cruel persecution of the Protestants, which has cast
so much infamy upon her reign, was not due, as commonly
supposed, to inhumanity on her part. When the kingdom
was reconciled to Rome and absolved by Cardinal Pole, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page816" id="page816"></a>816</span>
followed, almost as a matter of necessity, that the old heresy
laws should be revived, as they were then by Act of Parliament.
They had been abolished by the Protector Somerset for the
express purpose of promoting changes of doctrine which did
violence to what was still the prevailing religious sentiment;
and now the old religion required to be protected from insult
and fanatical outrages. Doubts were felt as to the result
even from the first; but the law having been once passed could
not be relaxed merely because the victims were so numerous;
for that would only have encouraged the irreverence which
it was intended to check. No doubt there were milder men
among the heretics, but as a class their stern fanaticism and
ill-will to the old religion made them dangerous, even to the
public peace. Rogers, the first of the martyrs, was burnt on
the 4th of February 1555. Hooper, bishop of Gloucester,
had been condemned six days before, and suffered the same
fate upon the 9th. From this time the persecution went on
uninterrupted for three years and three quarters, numbering
among its victims Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer. It came
to an end at last on the death of Mary. It seems to have
been more severe in the eastern and southern parts of
England, and the largest number of sufferers was naturally
in the diocese of Bonner, bishop of London. From first
to last nearly three hundred victims are known to have
perished at the stake; and their fate certainly created a
revulsion against Rome that nothing else was likely to have
effected.</p>

<p>Mary was of weak constitution and subject to frequent
illnesses, both before and after her accession. One special
infirmity caused her to believe a few months after her marriage
that she was with child, and thanksgiving services were ordered
throughout the diocese of London in November 1554. The
same delusion recurred in March 1558, when though she did
not make her expectation public, she drew up a will in anticipation
of the dangers of childbirth, constituting her husband
regent during the minority of her prospective heir. To this
she added a codicil on the 28th of October following, when
the illness that was to be her last had set in, showing that she
had ceased to have much expectation of maternity, and earnestly
entreating her &ldquo;next heir and successor by the laws&rdquo; (whom
she did not name) to allow execution of the instrument. She
died on the 17th of November.</p>

<p>Her name deserved better treatment than it has generally
met with; for she was far from cruel. Her kindness to poor
people is undoubted, and the severe execution of her laws
seemed only a necessity. Even in this matter, moreover, she
was alive to the injustice with which the law was usually strained
in behalf of the prerogative; and in appointing Sir Richard
Morgan chief justice of the Common Pleas she charged him
&ldquo;not to sit in judgment otherwise for her highness than for
her subjects,&rdquo; and to avoid the old error of refusing to admit
witnesses against the Crown (Holinshed III. 1112). Her conduct
as queen was certainly governed by the best possible intentions;
and it is evident that her very zeal for goodness caused most
of the trouble she brought upon herself. Her subjects were
entirely released, even by papal authority, from any obligation
to restore the confiscated lands of the Church. But she herself
made it an object, at her own expense, to restore several of
the monasteries; and courtiers who did not like to follow her
example, encouraged the fanatics to spread an alarm that it
would even yet be made compulsory. So the worldly minded
joined hands with the godly heretics in stirring up enmity

<p><span class="bold">MARY II.<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (1662-1694), queen of England and wife of king
William III., elder daughter of James, duke of York, afterwards
King James II., by his first wife, Anne, daughter of Edward
Hyde, 1st earl of Clarendon, was born in London on the 30th
of April 1662. She was educated as a Protestant, and as it was
probable that she would succeed to the English throne after
the deaths of her uncle, Charles II., and her father, the choice
of a husband for her was a political event of high importance.
About 1672 the name of William, prince of Orange, was mentioned
in this connexion; and after some hesitation on both
sides caused by the condition of European politics, the betrothal
of William and Mary took place in October 1677, and was
quickly followed by their marriage in London on the 4th of
November. Mary&rsquo;s married life in Holland does not appear
to have been a happy one. Although she soon became popular
among the Dutch, she remained childless, while William treated
her with neglect and even with insult; and her troubles were
not diminished after her father became king of England in 1685.
James had treated his daughter very shabbily in money matters;
and it was increasingly difficult for her to remain loyal to both
father and husband when they were so divergent in character
and policy. Although Mary never entirely lost her affection
for her father the wife prevailed over the daughter; and after
the birth of her half-brother, the prince of Wales, in 1688,
she regarded the dethronement of James as inevitable. It
cannot be said, however, that William merited this confidence.
Possibly he was jealous of his wife as the heiress of the English
throne, contrasting her future position with his own; but according
to Burnet, who was then staying at the Hague, this cause of
difference was removed by the tactful interference of Burnet
himself. The latter asserts that having divined the reason
of the prince&rsquo;s jealousy he mentioned the matter to the princess,
who in her ignorance of statecraft had never considered the
relative positions of herself and her husband with regard to
the English throne; and that Mary, by telling the prince &ldquo;she
would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that
lay in her power to make him king for life&rdquo; (Burnet, <i>Supplement</i>,
ed. Foxcroft, p. 309), probably mollified her husband&rsquo;s jealousy.
On the other hand Macaulay&rsquo;s statement that henceforward
there was &ldquo;entire friendship and confidence&rdquo; between them
must be taken with some reserve. Mary shared heartily in the
events which immediately preceded William&rsquo;s expedition to
England in 1688. After the success of the undertaking she
arrived in London in February 1689; and by her faithful adherence
to her promise made a satisfactory settlement of the English
crown possible. William and Mary were together proclaimed
king and queen of England, and afterwards of Scotland, and
were crowned on the 11th of April 1689. During the king&rsquo;s
absence from England the queen, assisted by a committee of
the privy council, was entrusted with the duties of government,
duties which she performed faithfully, but which she gladly
laid down on William&rsquo;s return. In these times of danger,
however, she acted when necessary with courage and promptitude,
as when in 1690 she directed the arrest of her uncle Henry
Hyde, 2nd earl of Clarendon; but she was constantly anxious
for William&rsquo;s safety, and unable to trust many of her advisers.
She was further distressed by a quarrel with her sister Anne
in 1692 following the dismissal of Marlborough, and this event
somewhat diminished her popularity, which had hitherto been
one of the mainstays of the throne. Weak in body and troubled
in mind, the queen died at Kensington Palace from small-pox
on the 28th of December 1694, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey. Mary was a woman of a remarkably modest and
retiring disposition, whose outstanding virtue was perhaps
her unswerving loyalty to William. Burnet has passed a
remarkable panegyric upon her character. She was extremely
pious and charitable; her blameless private life was in marked
contrast with her surroundings, both in England and Holland;
without bigotry she was greatly attached to the Protestant
faith and to the Church of England; and she was always eager
to improve the tone of public morals, and to secure a better
observance of Sunday. Greenwich Hospital for Seamen was
founded in her honour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span><a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (1542-1587), daughter of King James
V. and his wife Mary of Lorraine, was born in December 1542,
a few days before the death of her father, heart-broken by the
disgrace of his arms at Solway Moss, where the disaffected nobles
had declined to encounter an enemy of inferior force in the cause
of a king whose systematic policy had been directed against
the privileges of their order, and whose representative on the
occasion was an unpopular favourite appointed general in
defiance of their ill-will. On the 9th of September following the
ceremony of coronation was duly performed upon the infant.
A scheme for her betrothal to Edward, prince of Wales, was defeated
by the grasping greed of his father, whose obvious ambition
to annex the crown of Scotland at once to that of England
aroused instantly the general suspicion and indignation of Scottish
patriotism. In 1548 the queen of six years old was betrothed
to the dauphin Francis, and set sail for France, where she arrived
on the 15th of August. The society in which the child was
thenceforward reared is known to readers of Brantôme as well
as that of imperial Rome at its worst is known to readers of
Suetonius or Petronius as well as that of papal Rome at its worst
is known to readers of the diary kept by the domestic chaplain of
Pope Alexander VI. Only in their pages can a parallel be found
to the gay and easy record which reveals without sign of shame or
suspicion of offence the daily life of a court compared to which
the court of King Charles II. is as the court of Queen Victoria
to the society described by Grammont. Debauchery of all
kinds, and murder in all forms, were the daily matter of excitement
or of jest to the brilliant circle which revolved around
Queen Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. After ten years&rsquo; training under the
tutelage of the woman whose main instrument of policy was the
corruption of her own children, the queen of Scots, aged fifteen
years and five months, was married to the eldest and feeblest of
the brood on the 24th of April 1558. On the 17th of November
Elizabeth became queen of England, and the princes of Lorraine&mdash;Francis
the great duke of Guise, and his brother the cardinal&mdash;induced
their niece and her husband to assume, in addition to
the arms of France and Scotland, the arms of a country over
which they asserted the right of Mary Stuart to reign as legitimate
heiress of Mary Tudor. Civil strife broke out in Scotland
between John Knox and the queen-dowager&mdash;between the self-styled
&ldquo;congregation of the Lord&rdquo; and the adherents of the
regent, whose French troops repelled the combined forces of
the Scotch and their English allies from the beleaguered walls of
Leith, little more than a month before the death of their mistress
in the castle of Edinburgh, on the 10th of June 1560. On the
25th of August Protestantism was proclaimed and Catholicism
suppressed in Scotland by a convention of states assembled
without the assent of the absent queen. On the 5th of December
Francis II. died; in August 1561 his widow left France for
Scotland, having been refused a safe-conduct by Elizabeth on
the ground of her own previous refusal to ratify the treaty made
with England by her commissioners in the same month of the
preceding year. She arrived nevertheless in safety at Leith, escorted
by three of her uncles of the house of Lorraine, and bringing
in her train her future biographer, Brantôme, and Chastelard,
the first of all her voluntary victims. On the 21st of August
she first met the only man able to withstand her; and their first
passage of arms left, as he has recorded, upon the mind of
John Knox an ineffaceable impression of her &ldquo;proud mind,
crafty wit and indurate heart against God and His truth.&rdquo; And
yet her acts of concession and conciliation were such as no
fanatic on the opposite side could have approved. She assented,
not only to the undisturbed maintenance of the new creed, but
even to a scheme for the endowment of the Protestant ministry
out of the confiscated lands of the Church. Her half-brother,
Lord James Stuart, shared the duties of her chief counsellor with
William Maitland of Lethington, the keenest and most liberal
thinker in the country. By the influence of Lord James, in
spite of the earnest opposition of Knox, permission was obtained
for her to hear Mass celebrated in her private chapel&mdash;a licence
to which, said the Reformer, he would have preferred the invasion
of ten thousand Frenchmen. Through all the first troubles of
her reign the young queen steered her skilful and dauntless way
with the tact of a woman and the courage of a man. An insurrection
in the north, headed by the earl of Huntly under pretext
of rescuing from justice the life which his son had forfeited by his
share in a homicidal brawl, was crushed at a blow by the Lord
James against whose life, as well as against his sister&rsquo;s liberty,
the conspiracy of the Gordons had been aimed, and on whom,
after the father had fallen in fight and the son had expiated his
double offence on the scaffold, the leading rebel&rsquo;s earldom of
Murray was conferred by the gratitude of the queen. Exactly
four months after the battle of Corrichie, and the subsequent
execution of a criminal whom she is said to have &ldquo;loved entirely,&rdquo;
had put an end to the first insurrection raised against her,
Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, who had returned to France
with the other companions of her arrival, and in November 1562
had revisited Scotland, expiated with his head the offence or the
misfortune of a second detection at night in her bedchamber.
In the same month, twenty-five years afterwards, the execution
of his mistress, according to the verdict of her contemporaries
in France, avenged the blood of a lover who had died without
uttering a word to realize the apprehension which (according to
Knox) had before his trial impelled her to desire her brother
&ldquo;that, as he loved her, he would slay Chastelard, and let him
never speak word.&rdquo; And in the same month, two years from the
date of Chastelard&rsquo;s execution, her first step was unconsciously
taken on the road to Fotheringhay, when she gave her heart at
first sight to her kinsman Henry, Lord Darnley, son of Matthew
Stuart, earl of Lennox, who had suffered an exile of twenty years
in expiation of his intrigues with England, and had married the
niece of King Henry VIII., daughter of his sister Margaret, the
widow of James IV., by her second husband, the earl of Angus.
Queen Elizabeth, with the almost incredible want of tact or
instinctive delicacy which distinguished and disfigured her
vigorous intelligence, had recently proposed as a suitor to the
queen of Scots her own low-born favourite, Lord Robert Dudley,
the widower if not the murderer of Amy Robsart; and she now
protested against the project of marriage between Mary and
Darnley. Mary who had already married her kinsman in secret
at Stirling Castle with Catholic rites celebrated in the apartment
of David Rizzio, her secretary for correspondence with France,
assured the English ambassador, in reply to the protest of his
mistress, that the marriage would not take place for three
months, when a dispensation from the pope would allow the
cousins to be publicly united without offence to the Church. On
the 29th of July 1565 they were accordingly remarried at
Holyrood. The hapless and worthless bridegroom had already
incurred the hatred of two powerful enemies, the earls of Morton
and Glencairn; but the former of these took part with the queen
against the forces raised by Murray, Glencairn and others, under
the nominal leadership of Hamilton, duke of Châtelherault, on
the double plea of danger to the new religion of the country, and
of the illegal proceeding by which Darnley had been proclaimed
king of Scots without the needful constitutional assent of the
estates of the realm. Murray was cited to attend the &ldquo;raid&rdquo;
or array levied by the king and queen, and was duly denounced
by public blast of trumpet for his non-appearance. He entered
Edinburgh with his forces, but failed to hold the town against
the guns of the castle, and fell back upon Dumfries before the
advance of the royal army, which was now joined by James
Hepburn, earl of Bothwell, on his return from a three years&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page818" id="page818"></a>818</span>
outlawed exile in France. He had been accused in 1562 of a
plot to seize the queen and put her into the keeping of the earl of
Arran, whose pretensions to her hand ended only when his
insanity could no longer be concealed. Another new adherent
was the son of the late earl of Huntly, to whom the forfeited
honours of his house were restored a few months before the
marriage of his sister to Bothwell. The queen now appealed to
France for aid; but Castelnau, the French ambassador, replied
to her passionate pleading by sober and earnest advice to make
peace with the malcontents. This counsel was rejected, and in
October 1565 the queen marched an army of 18,000 men against
them from Edinburgh; their forces dispersed in face of superior
numbers, and Murray, on seeking shelter in England, was
received with contumely by Elizabeth, whose half-hearted help
had failed to support his enterprise, and whose intercession for
his return found at first no favour with the queen of Scots. But
the conduct of the besotted boy on whom at their marriage she
had bestowed the title of king began at once to justify the enterprise
and to play into the hands of all his enemies alike. His
father set him on to demand the crown matrimonial, which
would at least have assured to him the rank and station of independent
royalty for life. Rizzio, hitherto his friend and advocate,
induced the queen to reply by a reasonable refusal to this
hazardous and audacious request. Darnley at once threw himself
into the arms of the party opposed to the policy of the queen
and her secretary&mdash;a policy which at that moment was doubly
and trebly calculated to exasperate the fears of the religious and
the pride of the patriotic. Mary was invited if not induced by
the king of Spain to join his league for the suppression of Protestantism;
while the actual or prospective endowment of Rizzio
with Morton&rsquo;s office of chancellor, and the projected attainder of
Murray and his allies, combined to inflame at once the anger and
the apprehension of the Protestant nobles. According to one
account, Darnley privately assured his uncle George Douglas of
his wife&rsquo;s infidelity; he had himself, if he might be believed,
discovered the secretary in the queen&rsquo;s apartment at midnight,
under circumstances yet more unequivocally compromising than
those which had brought Chastelard to the scaffold. Another
version of the pitiful history represents Douglas as infusing
suspicion of Rizzio into the empty mind of his nephew, and thus
winning his consent to a deed already designed by others. A
bond was drawn in which Darnley pledged himself to support
the confederates who undertook to punish &ldquo;certain privy
persons&rdquo; offensive to the state, &ldquo;especially a strange Italian,
called Davie&rdquo;; another was subscribed by Darnley and the
banished lords, then biding their time in Newcastle, which
engaged him to procure their pardon and restoration, while
pledging them to insure to him the enjoyment of the title he
coveted, with the consequent security of an undisputed succession
to the crown, despite the counter claims of the house of
Hamilton, in case his wife should die without issue&mdash;a result
which, intentionally or not, he and his fellow-conspirators did
all that brutality could have suggested to accelerate and secure.
On the 9th of March the palace of Holyrood was invested by a
troop under the command of Morton, while Rizzio was dragged
by force out of the queen&rsquo;s presence and slain without trial in
the heat of the moment. The parliament was discharged by
proclamation issued in the name of Darnley as king; and in the
evening of the next day the banished lords, whom it was to have
condemned to outlawry, returned to Edinburgh. On the day
following they were graciously received by the queen, who undertook
to sign a bond for their security, but delayed the subscription
till next morning under plea of sickness. During the night
she escaped with Darnley, whom she had already seduced from
the party of his accomplices, and arrived at Dunbar on the third
morning after the slaughter of her favourite. From thence they
returned to Edinburgh on the 28th of March, guarded by two
thousand horsemen under the command of Bothwell, who had
escaped from Holyrood on the night of the murder, to raise a
force on the queen&rsquo;s behalf with his usual soldierly promptitude.
The slayers of Rizzio fled to England, and were outlawed;
Darnley was permitted to protest his innocence and denounce
his accomplices; after which he became the scorn of all parties
alike, and few men dared or cared to be seen in his company.
On the 19th of June a son was born to his wife, and in the
face of his previous protestations he was induced to acknowledge
himself the father. But, as Murray and his partisans
returned to favour and influence no longer incompatible with
that of Bothwell and Huntly, he grew desperate enough with
terror to dream of escape to France. This design was at once
frustrated by the queen&rsquo;s resolution. She summoned him to
declare his reasons for it in presence of the French ambassador
and an assembly of the nobles; she besought him for God&rsquo;s sake
to speak out, and not spare her; and at last he left her presence
with an avowal that he had nothing to allege. The favour
shown to Bothwell had not yet given occasion for scandal,
though his character as an adventurous libertine was as notable
as his reputation for military hardihood; but as the summer
advanced his insolence increased with his influence at court and
the general aversion of his rivals. He was richly endowed by
Mary from the greater and lesser spoils of the Church; and the
three wardenships of the border, united for the first time in his
person, gave the lord high admiral of Scotland a position of
unequalled power. In the gallant discharge of its duties he
was dangerously wounded by a leading outlaw, whom he slew
in single combat; and while yet confined to Hermitage Castle
he received a visit of two hours from the queen, who rode thither
from Jedburgh and back through 20 miles of the wild borderland
where her person was in perpetual danger from the freebooters
whom her father&rsquo;s policy had striven and had failed to extirpate.
The result of this daring ride was a ten days&rsquo; fever, after which
she removed by short stages to Craigmillar, where a proposal
for her divorce from Darnley was laid before her by Bothwell,
Murray, Huntly, Argyle and Lethington, who was chosen spokesman
for the rest. She assented on condition that the divorce
could be lawfully effected without impeachment of her son&rsquo;s
legitimacy; whereupon Lethington undertook in the name of all
present that she should be rid of her husband without any prejudice
to the child&mdash;at whose baptism a few days afterwards
Bothwell took the place of the putative father, though Darnley
was actually residing under the same roof, and it was not till
after the ceremony that he was suddenly struck down by a
sickness so violent as to excite suspicions of poison. He was
removed to Glasgow, and left for the time in charge of his father;
but on the news of his progress towards recovery a bond was
drawn up for execution of the sentence of death which had
secretly been pronounced against the twice-turned traitor who
had earned his doom at all hands alike. On the 22nd of the next
month (Jan. 1567) the queen visited her husband at Glasgow and
proposed to remove him to Craigmillar Castle, where he would
have the benefit of medicinal baths; but instead of this resort
he was conveyed on the last day of the month to the lonely and
squalid shelter of the residence which was soon to be made
memorable by his murder. Between the ruins of two sacred
buildings, with the town-wall to the south and a suburban
hamlet known to ill fame as the Thieves&rsquo; Row to the north of it,
a lodging was prepared for the titular king of Scotland, and fitted
up with tapestries taken from the Gordons after the battle of
Corrichie. On the evening of Sunday, the 9th of February, Mary
took her last leave of the miserable boy who had so often and so
mortally outraged her as consort and as queen. That night the
whole city was shaken out of sleep by an explosion of gunpowder
which shattered to fragments the building in which he should
have slept and perished; and the next morning the bodies of Darnley
and a page were found strangled in a garden adjoining it, whither
they had apparently escaped over a wall, to be despatched by the
hands of Bothwell s attendant confederates.</p>

<p>Upon a view which may be taken of Mary&rsquo;s conduct during
the next three months depends the whole debateable question of
her character. According to the professed champions of that
character, this conduct was a tissue of such dastardly imbecility,
such heartless irresolution and such brainless inconsistency as
for ever to dispose of her time-honoured claim to the credit of
intelligence and courage. It is certain that just three months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page819" id="page819"></a>819</span>
and six days after the murder of her husband she became the
wife of her husband&rsquo;s murderer. On the 11th of February she
wrote to the bishop of Glasgow, her ambassador in France, a
brief letter of simple eloquence, announcing her providential
escape from a design upon her own as well as her husband&rsquo;s life.
A reward of two thousand pounds was offered by proclamation
for discovery of the murderer. Bothwell and others, his
satellites or the queen&rsquo;s, were instantly placarded by name as
the criminals. Voices were heard by night in the streets of
Edinburgh calling down judgment on the assassins. Four days
after the discovery of the bodies, Darnley was buried in the
chapel of Holyrood with secrecy as remarkable as the solemnity
with which Rizzio had been interred there less than a year
before. On the Sunday following, Mary left Edinburgh for
Seton Palace, 12 miles from the capital, where scandal asserted
that she passed the time merrily in shooting-matches with Bothwell
for her partner against Lords Seton and Huntly; other
accounts represent Huntly and Bothwell as left at Holyrood in
charge of the infant prince. Gracefully and respectfully, with
statesmanlike yet feminine dexterity, the demands of Darnley&rsquo;s
father for justice on the murderers of his son were accepted and
eluded by his daughter-in-law. Bothwell, with a troop of fifty
men, rode through Edinburgh defiantly denouncing vengeance
on his concealed accusers. As weeks elapsed without action
on the part of the royal widow, while the cry of blood was up
throughout the country, raising echoes from England and abroad,
the murmur of accusation began to rise against her also. Murray,
with his sister&rsquo;s ready permission, withdrew to France.
Already the report was abroad that the queen was bent on marriage
with Bothwell, whose last year&rsquo;s marriage with the sister of
Huntly would be dissolved, and the assent of his wife&rsquo;s brother
purchased by the restitution of his forfeited estates. According
to the <i>Memoirs</i> of Sir James Melville, both Lord Herries and
himself resolved to appeal to the queen in terms of bold and
earnest remonstrance against so desperate and scandalous a
design; Herries, having been met with assurances of its unreality
and professions of astonishment at the suggestion, instantly fled
from court; Melville, evading the danger of a merely personal
protest without backers to support him, laid before Mary a letter
from a loyal Scot long resident in England, which urged upon her
consideration and her conscience the danger and disgrace of such
a project yet more freely than Herries had ventured to do by
word of mouth; but the sole result was that it needed all
the queen&rsquo;s courage and resolution to rescue him from the
violence of the man for whom, she was reported to have said, she
cared not if she lost France, England and her own country, and
would go with him to the world&rsquo;s end in a white petticoat before
she would leave him. On the 28th of March the privy council,
in which Bothwell himself sat, appointed the 12th of April
as the day of his trial, Lennox, instead of the crown, being
named as the accuser, and cited by royal letters to appear at
&ldquo;the humble request and petition of the said Earl Bothwell,&rdquo;
who, on the day of the trial, had 4000 armed men behind
him in the streets, while the castle was also at his command.
Under these arrangements it was not thought wonderful that
Lennox discreetly declined the danger of attendance, even with
3000 men ready to follow him, at the risk of desperate
street fighting. He pleaded sickness, asked for more time, and
demanded that the accused, instead of enjoying special favour,
should share the treatment of other suspected criminals. But,
as no particle of evidence on his side was advanced, the protest
of his representative was rejected, and Bothwell, acquitted in
default of witnesses against him, was free to challenge any
persistent accuser to the ancient ordeal of battle. His wealth
and power were enlarged by gift of the parliament which met on
the 14th and rose on the 19th of April&mdash;a date made notable
by the subsequent supper at Ainslie&rsquo;s tavern, where Bothwell
obtained the signatures of its leading members to a document
affirming his innocence, and pledging the subscribers to maintain
it against all challengers, to stand by him in all his quarrels
and finally to promote by all means in their power the
marriage by which they recommended the queen to reward his
services and benefit the country. On the second day following
Mary went to visit her child at Stirling, where his guardian,
the earl of Mar, refused to admit more than two women in
her train. It was well known in Edinburgh that Bothwell
had a body of men ready to intercept her on the way back, and
carry her to Dunbar&mdash;not, as was naturally inferred, without
good assurance of her consent. On the 24th of April, as
she approached Edinburgh, Bothwell accordingly met her
at the head of 800 spearmen, assured her (as she afterwards
averred) that she was in the utmost peril, and escorted
her, together with Huntly, Lethington and Melville, who were
then in attendance, to Dunbar Castle. On the 3rd of May Lady
Jane Gordon, who had become countess of Bothwell on the 22nd
of February of the year preceding, obtained, on the ground of her
husband&rsquo;s infidelities, a separation which, however, would not
under the old laws of Catholic Scotland have left him free to
marry again; on the 7th, accordingly, the necessary divorce was
pronounced, after two days&rsquo; session, by a clerical tribunal which
ten days before had received from the queen a special commission
to give judgment on a plea of somewhat apocryphal consanguinity
alleged by Bothwell as the ground of an action for divorce against
his wife. The fact was studiously evaded or concealed that a
dispensation had been granted by the archbishop of St Andrews
for this irregularity, which could only have arisen through some
illicit connexion of the husband with a relative of the wife between
whom and himself no affinity by blood or marriage could
be proved. On the day when the first or Protestant divorce was
pronounced, Mary and Bothwell returned to Edinburgh with
every prepared appearance of a peaceful triumph. Lest her
captivity should have been held to invalidate the late legal
proceedings in her name, proclamation was made of forgiveness
accorded by the queen to her captor in consideration of his past
and future services, and her intention was announced to reward
them by further promotion; and on the same day (May 12), he
was duly created duke of Orkney and Shetland. The duke, as a
conscientious Protestant, refused to marry his mistress according
to the rites of her Church, and she, the chosen champion of its
cause, agreed to be married to him, not merely by a Protestant
but by one who before his conversion had been a Catholic bishop,
and should therefore have been more hateful and contemptible
in her eyes than any ordinary heretic, had not religion as well
as policy, faith as well as reason, been absorbed or superseded
by some more mastering passion or emotion. This passion or
emotion, according to those who deny her attachment to Bothwell,
was simply terror&mdash;the blind and irrational prostration of
an abject spirit before the cruel force of circumstances and the
crafty wickedness of men. Hitherto, according to all evidence,
she had shown herself on all occasions, as on all subsequent
occasions she indisputably showed herself, the most fearless, the
most keen-sighted, the most ready-witted, the most high-gifted
and high-spirited of women; gallant and generous, skilful and
practical, never to be cowed by fortune, never to be cajoled by
craft; neither more unselfish in her ends nor more unscrupulous
in her practice than might have been expected from her training
and her creed. But at the crowning moment of trial there are
those who assert their belief that the woman who on her way to
the field of Corrichie had uttered her wish to be a man, that she
might know all the hardship and all the enjoyment of a soldier&rsquo;s
life, riding forth &ldquo;in jack and knapscull&rdquo;&mdash;the woman who
long afterwards was to hold her own for two days together
without help of counsel against all the array of English law and
English statesmanship, armed with irrefragable evidence and
supported by the resentment of a nation&mdash;showed herself
equally devoid of moral and of physical resolution; too senseless
to realize the significance and too heartless to face the danger of
a situation from which the simplest exercise of reason, principle
or courage must have rescued the most unsuspicious and
inexperienced of honest women who was not helplessly deficient
in self-reliance and self-respect. The famous correspondence
produced next year in evidence against her at the conference of
York may have been, as her partisans affirm, so craftily garbled
and falsified by interpolation, suppression, perversion, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page820" id="page820"></a>820</span>
absolute forgery as to be all but historically worthless. Its acceptance
or its rejection does not in any degree whatever affect, for
better or for worse, the rational estimate of her character. The
problem presented by the simple existence of the facts just
summed up remains in either case absolutely the same.</p>

<p>That the coarse and imperious nature of the hardy and able
ruffian who had now become openly her master should no less
openly have shown itself even in the first moments of their
inauspicious union is what any bystander of common insight
must inevitably have foreseen. Tears, dejection and passionate
expressions of a despair &ldquo;wishing only for death,&rdquo; bore fitful and
variable witness to her first sense of a heavier yoke than yet had
galled her spirit and her pride. At other times her affectionate
gaiety would give evidence as trustworthy of a fearless and
improvident satisfaction. They rode out in state together, and
if he kept cap in hand as a subject she would snatch it from him
and clap it on his head again; while in graver things she took all
due or possible care to gratify his ambition, by the insertion of
a clause in their contract of marriage which made their joint
signature necessary to all documents of state issued under the
sign-manual. She despatched to France a special envoy, the
bishop of Dumblane, with instructions setting forth at length
the unparalleled and hitherto ill-requited services and merits
of Bothwell, and the necessity of compliance at once with his
passion and with the unanimous counsel of the nation&mdash;a
people who would endure the rule of no foreign consort, and
whom none of their own countrymen were so competent to
control, alike by wisdom and by valour, as the incomparable
subject of her choice. These personal merits and this political
necessity were the only pleas advanced in a letter to her
ambassador in England. But that neither plea would avail
her for a moment in Scotland she had ominous evidence on
the thirteenth day after her marriage, when no response was
made to the usual form of proclamation for a raid or levy of
forces under pretext of a campaign against the rievers of the
border. On the 6th or 7th of June Mary and Bothwell took
refuge in Borthwick Castle, twelve miles from the capital, where
the fortress was in the keeping of an adherent whom the diplomacy
of Sir James Melville had succeeded in detaching from his
allegiance to Bothwell. The fugitives were pursued and beleaguered
by the earl of Morton and Lord Hume, who declared
their purpose to rescue the queen from the thraldom of her husband.
He escaped, leaving her free to follow him or to join the
party of her professed deliverers. But whatever cause she might
have found since marriage to complain of his rigorous custody
and domineering brutality was insufficient to break the ties by
which he held her. Alone, in the disguise of a page, she slipped
out of the castle at midnight, and rode off to meet him at a tower
two miles distant, whence they fled together to Dunbar. The
confederate lords on entering Edinburgh were welcomed by the
citizens, and after three hours&rsquo; persuasion Lethington, who had
now joined them, prevailed on the captain of the castle to deliver
it also into their hands. Proclamations were issued in which the
crime of Bothwell was denounced, and the disgrace of the country,
the thraldom of the queen and the mortal peril of her infant son,
were set forth as reasons for summoning all the lieges of the chief
cities of Scotland to rise in arms on three hours&rsquo; notice and join
the forces assembled against the one common enemy. News of
his approach reached them on the night of June 14, and they
marched before dawn with 2200 men to meet him near Musselburgh.
Mary meanwhile had passed from Dunbar to Haddington,
and thence to Seton, where 1600 men rallied to her side.
On the 15th of June, one month from their marriage day, the
queen and Bothwell, at the head of a force of fairly equal numbers
but visibly inferior discipline, met the army of the confederates
at Carberry Hill, some six miles from Edinburgh. Du Croc, the
French ambassador, obtained permission through the influence
of Maitland to convey to the queen the terms proposed by their
leaders&mdash;that she and Bothwell should part, or that he should
meet in single combat a champion chosen from among their
number. Bothwell offered to meet any man of sufficient
quality; Mary would not assent. As the afternoon wore on
their force began to melt away by desertion and to break up for
lack of discipline. Again the trial by single combat was proposed,
and thrice the proposal fell through, owing to objections on
this side or on that. At last it was agreed that the queen should
yield herself prisoner, and Bothwell be allowed to retire in safety
to Dunbar with the few followers who remained to him. Mary
took leave of her first and last master with passionate anguish
and many parting kisses; but in face of his enemies, and in hearing
of the cries which burst from the ranks, demanding her death
by fire as a murderess and harlot, the whole heroic and passionate
spirit of the woman, represented by her admirers as a spiritless
imbecile, flamed out in responsive threats to have all the men
hanged and crucified, in whose power she now stood helpless and
alone. She grasped the hand of Lord Lindsay as he rode beside
her, and swore &ldquo;by this hand&rdquo; she would &ldquo;have his head for
this.&rdquo; In Edinburgh she was received by a yelling mob, which
flaunted before her at each turn a banner representing the corpse
of Darnley with her child beside it invoking on his knees the
retribution of divine justice. From the violence of a multitude
in which women of the worst class were more furious than the
men she was sheltered in the house of the provost, where she
repeatedly showed herself at the window, appealing aloud with
dishevelled hair and dress to the mercy which no man could look
upon her and refuse. At nine in the evening she was removed to
Holyrood, and thence to the port of Leith, where she embarked
under guard, with her attendants, for the island castle of Lochleven.
On the 20th a silver casket containing letters and French
verses, miscalled sonnets, in the handwriting of the queen, was
taken from the person of a servant who had been sent by Bothwell
to bring it from Edinburgh to Dunbar. Even in the existing
versions of the letters, translated from the lost originals and
retranslated from this translation of a text which was probably
destroyed in 1603 by order of King James on his accession to
the English throne&mdash;even in these possibly disfigured versions,
the fiery pathos of passion, the fierce and piteous fluctuations of
spirit between love and hate, hope and rage and jealousy, have
an eloquence apparently beyond the imitation or invention of
art (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Casket Letters</a></span><a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a>). Three days after this discovery
Lord Lindsay, Lord Ruthven and Sir Robert Melville were
despatched to Lochleven, there to obtain the queen&rsquo;s signature
to an act of abdication in favour of her son, and another appointing
Murray regent during his minority. She submitted, and a
commission of regency was established till the return from
France of Murray, who, on the 15th of August, arrived at Lochleven
with Morton and Athole. According to his own account,
the expostulations as to her past conduct which preceded his
admonitions for the future were received with tears, confessions
and attempts at extenuation or excuse; but when they parted
next day on good terms she had regained her usual spirits.
Nor from that day forward had they reason to sink again,
in spite of the close keeping in which she was held, with the
daughters of the house for bedfellows. Their mother and the
regent&rsquo;s, her father&rsquo;s former mistress, was herself not impervious
to her prisoner&rsquo;s lifelong power of seduction and subjugation.
Her son George Douglas fell inevitably under the charm. A
rumour transmitted to England went so far as to assert that she
had proposed him to their common half-brother Murray as a
fourth husband for herself; a later tradition represented her as
the mother of a child by him. A third report, at least as improbable
as either, asserted that a daughter of Mary and Bothwell,
born about this time, lived to be a nun in France. It is
certain that the necessary removal of George Douglas from Lochleven
enabled him to devise a method of escape for the prisoner
on the 25th of March, 1568, which was frustrated by detection
of her white hands under the disguise of a laundress. But a
younger member of the household, Willie Douglas, aged eighteen,
whose devotion was afterwards remembered and his safety cared
for by Mary at a time of utmost risk and perplexity to herself,
succeeded on the 2nd of May in assisting her to escape by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page821" id="page821"></a>821</span>
postern gate to the lake-side, and thence in a boat to the mainland,
where George Douglas, Lord Seton and others were awaiting
her. Thence they rode to Seton&rsquo;s castle of Niddry, and
next day to Hamilton palace, round which an army of 6000 men
was soon assembled, and whither the new French ambassador
to Scotland hastened to pay his duty. The queen&rsquo;s abdication
was revoked, messengers were despatched to the English and
French courts, and word was sent to Murray at Glasgow that
he must resign the regency, and should be pardoned in common
with all offenders against the queen. But on the day when
Mary arrived at Hamilton Murray had summoned to Glasgow
the feudatories of the Crown to take arms against the insurgent
enemies of the infant king. Elizabeth sent conditional offers
of help to her kinswoman, provided she would accept of English
intervention and abstain from seeking foreign assistance; but
the messenger came too late. Mary&rsquo;s followers had failed to
retake Dunbar Castle from the regent, and made for Dumbarton
instead, marching two miles south of Glasgow, by the village
of Langside. Here Murray, with 4500 men, under leaders of
high distinction, met the 6000 of the queen&rsquo;s army, whose ablest
man, Herries, was as much distrusted by Mary as by every one
else, while the Hamiltons could only be trusted to think of their
own interests, and were suspected of treasonable designs on all
who stood between their house and the monarchy. On the 13th
of May the battle or skirmish of Langside determined the result
of the campaign in three-quarters of an hour. Kirkaldy of
Grange, who commanded the regent&rsquo;s cavalry, seized and kept
the place of vantage from the beginning, and at the first sign
of wavering on the other side shattered at a single charge the
forces of the queen with a loss of one man to three hundred.
Mary fled 60 miles from the field of her last battle before she
halted at Sanquhar, and for three days of flight, according to
her own account, had to sleep on the hard ground, live on oatmeal
and sour milk, and fare at night like the owls, in hunger,
cold and fear. On the third day from the rout of Langside she
crossed the Solway and landed at Workington in Cumberland,
May 16, 1568. On the 20th Lord Scrope and Sir Francis
Knollys were sent from court to carry messages and letters of
comfort from Elizabeth to Mary at Carlisle. On the 11th of
June Knollys wrote to Cecil at once the best description and the
noblest panegyric extant of the queen of Scots&mdash;enlarging, with
a brave man&rsquo;s sympathy, on her indifference to form and ceremony,
her daring grace and openness of manner, her frank display
of a great desire to be avenged of her enemies, her readiness
to expose herself to all perils in hope of victory, her delight to hear
of hardihood and courage, commending by name all her enemies
of approved valour, sparing no cowardice in her friends, but
above all things athirst for victory by any means at any price,
so that for its sake pain and peril seemed pleasant to her, and
wealth and all things, if compared with it, contemptible and vile.
What was to be done with such a princess, whether she were to be
nourished in one&rsquo;s bosom, above all whether it could be advisable
or safe to try any diplomatic tricks upon such a lady, Knollys
left for the minister to judge. It is remarkable that he should
not have discovered in her the qualities so obvious to modern
champions of her character&mdash;easiness, gullibility, incurable
innocence and invincible ignorance of evil, incapacity to suspect
or resent anything, readiness to believe and forgive all things.
On the 15th of July, after various delays interposed by her reluctance
to leave the neighbourhood of the border, where on her
arrival she had received the welcome and the homage of the
leading Catholic houses of Northumberland and Cumberland,
she was removed to Bolton Castle in North Yorkshire. During
her residence here a conference was held at York between her
own and Elizabeth&rsquo;s commissioners and those appointed to
represent her son as a king of Scots. These latter, of whom
Murray himself was the chief, privately laid before the English
commissioners the contents of the famous casket. On the 24th
of October the place of the conference was shifted from York to
London, where the inquiry was to be held before Queen Elizabeth
in council. Mary was already aware that the chief of the English
commissioners, the duke of Norfolk, was secretly an aspirant to
the peril of her hand; and on the 21st of October she gave the
first sign of assent to the suggestion of a divorce from Bothwell.
On the 26th of October the charge of complicity in the murder of
Darnley was distinctly brought forward against her in spite of
Norfolk&rsquo;s reluctance and Murray&rsquo;s previous hesitation. Elizabeth,
by the mouth of her chief justice, formally rebuked the
audacity of the subjects who durst bring such a charge against
their sovereign, and challenged them to advance their proofs.
They complied by the production of an indictment under five
heads, supported by the necessary evidence of documents. The
number of English commissioners was increased, and they were
bound to preserve secrecy as to the matters revealed. Further
evidence was supplied by Thomas Crawford, a retainer of the
house of Lennox, tallying so exactly with the text of the casket
letters as to have been cited in proof that the latter must needs
be a forgery. Elizabeth, on the close of the evidence, invited
Mary to reply to the proofs alleged before she could be admitted
to her presence; but Mary simply desired her commissioners to
withdraw from the conference. She declined with scorn the proposal
made by Elizabeth through Knollys, that she should sign a
second abdication in favour of her son. On the 10th of January,
1569, the judgment given at the conference acquitted Murray and
his adherents of rebellion, while affirming that nothing had been
proved against Mary&mdash;a verdict accepted by Murray as equivalent
to a practical recognition of his office as regent for the infant
king. This position he was not long to hold; and the fierce
exultation of Mary at the news of his murder gave to those who
believed in her complicity with the murderer, on whom a pension
was bestowed by her unblushing gratitude, fresh reason to fear,
if her liberty of correspondence and intrigue were not restrained,
the likelihood of a similar fate for Elizabeth. On the 26th of January
1569 she had been removed from Bolton Castle to Tutbury
in Staffordshire, where proposals were conveyed to her, at the
instigation of Leicester, for a marriage with the duke of Norfolk,
to which she gave a graciously conditional assent; but the discovery
of these proposals consigned Norfolk to the Tower, and
on the outbreak of an insurrection in the north Mary, by Lord
Hunsdon&rsquo;s advice, was again removed to Coventry, when a body
of her intending deliverers was within a day&rsquo;s ride of Tutbury.
On the 23rd of January following Murray was assassinated; and
a second northern insurrection was crushed in a single sharp fight
by Lord Hunsdon. In October Cecil had an interview with Mary
at Chatsworth, when the conditions of her possible restoration
to the throne in compliance with French demands were debated
at length. The queen of Scots, with dauntless dignity, refused
to yield the castles of Edinburgh and Dumbarton into English
keeping, or to deliver up her fugitive English partisans then in
Scotland; upon other points they came to terms, and the articles
were signed the 16th of October. On the same day Mary wrote to
Elizabeth, requesting with graceful earnestness the favour of an
interview which might reassure her against the suggestion that
this treaty was a mere pretence. On the 28th of November she
was removed to Sheffield Castle, where she remained for the next
<span class="correction" title="amended from fourteeen">fourteen</span> years in charge of the earl of Shrewsbury. The detection
of a plot, in which Norfolk was implicated, for the invasion of
England by Spain on behalf of Mary, who was then to take him
as the fourth and most contemptible of her husbands, made
necessary the reduction of her household and the stricter
confinement of her person. On the 28th of May 1572 a
demand from both houses of parliament for her execution
as well as Norfolk&rsquo;s was generously rejected by Elizabeth;
but after the punishment of the traitorous pretender to
her hand, on whom she had lavished many eloquent letters
of affectionate protestation, she fell into &ldquo;a passion of
sickness&rdquo; which convinced her honest keeper of her genuine
grief for the ducal caitiff. A treaty projected on the news of
the massacre of St Bartholomew, by which Mary should be sent
back to Scotland for immediate execution, was broken off by the
death of the earl of Mar, who had succeeded Lennox as regent;
nor was it found possible to come to acceptable terms on a like
understanding with his successor Morton, who in 1577 sent a
proposal to Mary for her restoration, which she declined, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page822" id="page822"></a>822</span>
suspicion of a plot laid to entrap her by the policy of Sir Francis
Walsingham, the most unscrupulously patriotic of her English
enemies, who four years afterwards sent word to Scotland that
the execution of Morton, so long the ally of England, would be
answered by the execution of Mary. But on that occasion
Elizabeth again refused her assent either to the trial of Mary or
to her transference from Sheffield to the Tower. In 1581 Mary
accepted the advice of Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and Henry III.
that she should allow her son&rsquo;s title to reign as king of Scotland
conjointly with herself when released and restored to a share of
the throne. This plan was but part of a scheme including the
invasion of England by her kinsman the duke of Guise, who was
to land in the north and raise a Scottish army to place the released
prisoner of Sheffield beside her son on the throne of Elizabeth.
After the overthrow of the Scottish accomplices in this
notable project, Mary poured forth upon Elizabeth a torrent of
pathetic and eloquent reproach for the many wrongs she had
suffered at the hands of her hostess, and pledged her honour to
the assurance that she now aspired to no kingdom but that of
heaven. In the spring of 1583 she retained enough of this saintly
resignation to ask for nothing but liberty, without a share in the
government of Scotland; but Lord Burghley not unreasonably
preferred, if feasible, to reconcile the alliance of her son with
the detention of his mother. In 1584 the long-suffering earl of
Shrewsbury was relieved of his fourteen years&rsquo; charge through
the involuntary good offices of his wife, whose daughter by her
first husband had married a brother of Darnley; and their
orphan child Arabella, born in England, of royal descent on the
father&rsquo;s side, was now, in the hopeful view of her grandmother,
a more plausible claimant than the king or queen of Scots to the
inheritance of the English throne. In December 1583 Mary had
laid before the French ambassador her first complaint of the
slanders spread by Lady Shrewsbury and her sons, who were
ultimately compelled to confess the falsehood of their imputations
on the queen of Scots and her keeper. It was probably at
the time when a desire for revenge on her calumniatress made
her think the opportunity good and safe for discharge of such a
two-edged dart at the countess and the queen that Mary wrote,
but abstained from despatching, the famous and terrible letter
in which, with many gracious excuses and professions of regret
and attachment, she transmits to Elizabeth a full and vivid
report of the hideous gossip retailed by Bess of Hardwick regarding
her character and person at a time when the reporter of these
abominations was on friendly terms with her husband&rsquo;s royal
charge. In the autumn of 1584 she was removed to Wingfield
Manor under charge of Sir Ralph Sadler and John Somers, who
accompanied her also on her next removal to Tutbury in January
1585. A letter received by her in that cold, dark and unhealthy
castle, of which fifteen years before she had made painful and
malodorous experience, assured her that her son would acknowledge
her only as queen-mother, and provoked at once the threat
of a parent&rsquo;s curse and an application to Elizabeth for sympathy.
In April 1585 Sir Amyas Paulet was appointed to the office of
which Sadler, accused of careless indulgence, had requested to
be relieved; and on Christmas Eve she was removed from the
hateful shelter of Tutbury to the castle of Chartley in the same
county. Her correspondence in cipher from thence with her English
agents abroad, intercepted by Walsingham and deciphered
by his secretary, gave eager encouragement to the design for
a Spanish invasion of England under the prince of Parma,&mdash;an
enterprise in which she would do her utmost to make her son
take part, and in case of his refusal would induce the Catholic
nobles of Scotland to betray him into the hands of Philip, from
whose tutelage he should be released only on her demand, or if
after her death he should wish to return, nor then unless he had
become a Catholic. But even these patriotic and maternal
schemes to consign her child and re-consign the kingdom to the
keeping of the Inquisition, incarnate in the widower of Mary
Tudor, were superseded by the attraction of a conspiracy against
the throne and life of Elizabeth. Anthony Babington, in his
boyhood a ward of Shrewsbury, resident in the household at
Sheffield Castle, and thus subjected to the charm before which so
many victims had already fallen, was now induced to undertake
the deliverance of the queen of Scots by the murder of the
queen of England. It is maintained by those admirers of Mary
who assume her to have been an almost absolute imbecile, gifted
with the power of imposing herself on the world as a woman of
unsurpassed ability, that, while cognisant of the plot for her
deliverance by English rebels and an invading army of foreign
auxiliaries, she might have been innocently unconscious that this
conspiracy involved the simultaneous assassination of Elizabeth.
In the conduct and detection of her correspondence with Babington,
traitor was played off against traitor, and spies were utilized
against assassins, with as little scruple as could be required or
expected in the diplomacy of the time. As in the case of the
casket letters, it is alleged that forgery was employed to interpolate
sufficient evidence of Mary&rsquo;s complicity in a design of
which it is thought credible that she was kept in ignorance by
the traitors and murderers who had enrolled themselves in her
service,&mdash;that one who pensioned the actual murderer of Murray
and a would-be murderer of Elizabeth was incapable of approving
what her keen and practised intelligence was too blunt and torpid
to anticipate as inevitable and inseparable from the general
design. In August the conspirators were netted, and Mary was
arrested at the gate of Tixall Park, whither Paulet had taken her
under pretence of a hunting party. At Tixall she was detained
till her papers at Chartley had undergone thorough research.
That she was at length taken in her own toils even such a dullard
as her admirers depict her could not have failed to understand;
that she was no such dastard as to desire or deserve such defenders
the whole brief course of her remaining life bore consistent
and irrefragable witness. Her first thought on her return to
Chartley was one of loyal gratitude and womanly sympathy.
She cheered the wife of her English secretary, now under arrest,
with promises to answer for her husband to all accusations
brought against him, took her new-born child from the mother&rsquo;s
arms, and in default of clergy baptized it, to Paulet&rsquo;s Puritanic
horror, with her own hands by her own name. The next or the
twin-born impulse of her indomitable nature was, as usual in all
times of danger, one of passionate and high-spirited defiance
on discovering the seizure of her papers. A fortnight afterwards
her keys and her money were confiscated, while she, bedridden
and unable to move her hand, could only ply the terrible weapon
of her bitter and fiery tongue. Her secretaries were examined
in London, and one of them gave evidence that she had first
heard of the conspiracy by letter from Babington, of whose
design against the life of Elizabeth she thought it best to take
no notice in her reply, though she did not hold herself bound to
reveal it. On the 25th of September she was removed to the
strong castle of Fotheringay in Northamptonshire. On the 6th
of October she was desired by letter from Elizabeth to answer
the charges brought against her before certain of the chief
English nobles appointed to sit in commission on the cause.
In spite of her first refusal to submit, she was induced by the
arguments of the vice-chamberlain, Sir Christopher Hatton, to
appear before this tribunal on condition that her protest should
be registered against the legality of its jurisdiction over a
sovereign, the next heir of the English crown.</p>

<p>On the 14th and 15th of October 1586 the trial was held in
the hall of Fotheringay Castle. Alone, &ldquo;without one counsellor
on her side among so many,&rdquo; Mary conducted the whole of her
own defence with courage incomparable and unsurpassable
ability. Pathos and indignation, subtlety and simplicity,
personal appeal and political reasoning, were the alternate
weapons with which she fought against all odds of evidence or
inference, and disputed step by step every inch of debatable
ground. She repeatedly insisted on the production of proof in her
own handwriting as to her complicity with the project of the
assassins who had expiated their crime on the 20th and 21st of
the month preceding. When the charge was shifted to the
question of her intrigues with Spain, she took her stand resolutely
on her own right to convey whatever right she possessed, though
now no kingdom was left her for disposal, to whomsoever she
might choose. One single slip she made in the whole course of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page823" id="page823"></a>823</span>
her defence; but none could have been more unluckily characteristic
and significant. When Burghley brought against her the
unanswerable charge of having at that moment in her service,
and in receipt of an annual pension, the instigator of a previous
attempt on the life of Elizabeth, she had the unwary audacity
to cite in her justification the pensions allowed by Elizabeth to
her adversaries in Scotland, and especially to her son. It is
remarkable that just two months later, in a conversation with
her keepers, she again made use of the same extraordinary
argument in reply to the same inevitable imputation, and would
not be brought to admit that the two cases were other than
parallel. But except for this single instance of oversight or
perversity her defence was throughout a masterpiece of indomitable
ingenuity, of delicate and steadfast courage, of womanly
dignity and genius. Finally she demanded, as she had demanded
before, a trial either before the estates of the realm lawfully
assembled or else before the queen in council. So closed the
second day of the trial; and before the next day&rsquo;s work could
begin a note of two or three lines hastily written at midnight
informed the commissioners that Elizabeth had suddenly determined
to adjourn the expected judgment and transfer the place
of it to the star-chamber. Here, on the 25th of October, the
commissioners again met; and one of them alone, Lord Zouch,
dissented from the verdict by which Mary was found guilty of
having, since the 1st of June preceding, compassed and imagined
divers matters tending to the destruction of Elizabeth. This
verdict was conveyed to her, about three weeks later, by Lord
Buckhurst and Robert Beale, clerk of the privy council. At
the intimation that her life was an impediment to the security
of the received religion, &ldquo;she seemed with a certain unwonted
alacrity to triumph, giving God thanks, and rejoicing in her
heart that she was held to be an instrument&rdquo; for the restoration
of her own faith. This note of exultation as in martyrdom was
maintained with unflinching courage to the last. She wrote to
Elizabeth and the duke of Guise two letters of almost matchless
eloquence and pathos, admirable especially for their loyal and
grateful remembrance of all her faithful servants. Between the
date of these letters and the day of her execution wellnigh three
months of suspense elapsed. Elizabeth, fearless almost to a
fault in face of physical danger, constant in her confidence even
after discovery of her narrow escape from the poisoned bullets
of household conspirators, was cowardly even to a crime in face
of subtler and more complicated peril. She rejected with
resolute dignity the intercession of French envoys for the life
of the queen-dowager of France; she allowed the sentence of
death to be proclaimed and welcomed with bonfires and bell-ringing
throughout the length of England; she yielded a respite
of twelve days to the pleading of the French ambassador, and
had a charge trumped up against him of participation in a
conspiracy against her life; at length, on the 1st of February
1587, she signed the death-warrant, and then made her secretaries
write word to Paulet of her displeasure that in all this
time he should not of himself have found out some way to shorten
the life of his prisoner, as in duty bound by his oath, and thus
relieve her singularly tender conscience from the guilt of bloodshed.
Paulet, with loyal and regretful indignation, declined the
disgrace proposed to him in a suggestion &ldquo;to shed blood without
law or warrant&rdquo;; and on the 7th of February the earls of
Shrewsbury and Kent arrived at Fotheringay with the commission
of the council for execution of the sentence given against
his prisoner. Mary received the announcement with majestic
tranquillity, expressing in dignified terms her readiness to die,
her consciousness that she was a martyr for her religion, and
her total ignorance of any conspiracy against the life of Elizabeth.
At night she took a graceful and affectionate leave of her attendants,
distributed among them her money and jewels, wrote out
in full the various legacies to be conveyed by her will, and charged
her apothecary Gorion with her last messages for the king of
Spain. In these messages the whole nature of the woman was
revealed. Not a single friend, not a single enemy, was forgotten;
the slightest service, the slightest wrong, had its place assigned
in her faithful and implacable memory for retribution or reward.
Forgiveness of injuries was as alien from her fierce and loyal
spirit as forgetfulness of benefits; the destruction of England
and its liberties by Spanish invasion and conquest was the
strongest aspiration of her parting soul. At eight next morning
she entered the hall of execution, having taken leave of the
weeping envoy from Scotland, to whom she gave a brief message
for her son; took her seat on the scaffold, listened with an air
of even cheerful unconcern to the reading of her sentence,
solemnly declared her innocence of the charge conveyed in it
and her consolation in the prospect of ultimate justice, rejected
the professional services of Richard Fletcher, dean of Peterborough,
lifted up her voice in Latin against his in English
prayer, and when he and his fellow-worshippers had fallen duly
silent prayed aloud for the prosperity of her own church, for
Elizabeth, for her son, and for all the enemies whom she had
commended overnight to the notice of the Spanish invader;
then, with no less courage than had marked every hour and
every action of her life, received the stroke of death from the
wavering hand of the headsman.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart was in many respects the creature of her age,
of her creed, and of her station; but the noblest and most
noteworthy qualities of her nature were independent of rank,
opinion or time. Even the detractors who defend her conduct
on the plea that she was a dastard and a dupe are compelled in
the same breath to retract this implied reproach, and to admit,
with illogical acclamation and incongruous applause, that the
world never saw more splendid courage at the service of more
brilliant intelligence, that a braver if not &ldquo;a rarer spirit never
did steer humanity.&rdquo; A kinder or more faithful friend, a
deadlier or more dangerous enemy, it would be impossible to
dread or to desire. Passion alone could shake the double fortress
of her impregnable heart and ever-active brain. The passion
of love, after very sufficient experience, she apparently and
naturally outlived; the passion of hatred and revenge was as
inextinguishable in her inmost nature as the emotion of loyalty
and gratitude. Of repentance it would seem that she knew as
little as of fear, having been trained from her infancy in a religion
where the Decalogue was supplanted by the Creed. Adept as
she was in the most exquisite delicacy of dissimulation, the
most salient note of her original disposition was daring rather
than subtlety. Beside or behind the voluptuous or intellectual
attractions of beauty and culture, she had about her the fresher
charm of a fearless and frank simplicity, a genuine and enduring
pleasure in small and harmless things no less than in such as
were neither. In 1562 she amused herself for some days by
living &ldquo;with her little troop&rdquo; in the house of a burgess of St
Andrews &ldquo;like a burgess&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; assuring the English ambassador
that he should not find the queen there,&mdash;&ldquo;nor I know
not myself where she is become.&rdquo; From Sheffield Lodge, twelve
years later, she applied to the archbishop of Glasgow and the
cardinal of Guise for some pretty little dogs, to be sent her in
baskets very warmly packed,&mdash;&ldquo;for besides reading and working,
I take pleasure only in all the little animals that I can get.&rdquo; No
lapse of reconciling time, no extent of comparative indulgence,
could break her in to resignation, submission, or toleration of
even partial restraint. Three months after the massacre of St
Bartholomew had caused some additional restrictions to be
placed upon her freedom of action, Shrewsbury writes to Burghley
that &ldquo;rather than continue this imprisonment she sticks not to
say she will give her body, her son, and country for liberty&rdquo;; nor
did she ever show any excess of regard for any of the three.
For her own freedom of will and of way, of passion and of
action, she cared much; for her creed she cared something; for
her country she cared less than nothing. She would have flung
Scotland with England into the hell fire of Spanish Catholicism
rather than forgo the faintest chance of personal revenge. Her
profession of a desire to be instructed in the doctrines of Anglican
Protestantism was so transparently a pious fraud as rather to
afford confirmation than to arouse suspicion of her fidelity to
the teaching of her church. Elizabeth, so shamefully her
inferior in personal loyalty, fidelity and gratitude, was as clearly
her superior on the one all-important point of patriotism. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page824" id="page824"></a>824</span>
saving salt of Elizabeth&rsquo;s character, with all its wellnigh incredible
mixture of heroism and egotism, meanness and magnificence,
was simply this, that, overmuch as she loved herself, she did yet
love England better. Her best though not her only fine qualities
were national and political, the high public virtues of a good
public servant; in the private and personal qualities which
attract and attach a friend to his friend and a follower to his
leader, no man or woman was ever more constant and more
eminent than Mary Queen of Scots.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1457-1482), duchess of Burgundy, only child of
Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, and his wife Isabella of
Bourbon, was born on the 13th of February 1457. As heiress
of the rich Burgundian domains her hand was eagerly sought
by a number of princes. When her father fell upon the field of
Nancy, on the 5th of January 1477, Mary was not yet twenty
years of age. Louis XI. of France seized the opportunity
afforded by his rival&rsquo;s defeat and death to take possession of
the duchy of Burgundy as a fief lapsed to the French crown,
and also of Franche Comté, Picardy and Artois. He was
anxious that Mary should marry the Dauphin Charles and thus
secure the inheritance of the Netherlands for his descendants.
Mary, however, distrusted Louis; declined the French alliance,
and turned to her Netherland subjects for help. She obtained
the help only at the price of great concessions. On the 11th of
February 1477 she was compelled to sign a charter of rights,
known as &ldquo;the Great Privilege,&rdquo; by which the provinces and
towns of the Netherlands recovered all the local and communal
rights which had been abolished by the arbitrary decrees of
the dukes of Burgundy in their efforts to create in the Low
Countries a centralized state. Mary had to undertake not to
declare war, make peace, or raise taxes without the consent of
the States, and not to employ any but natives in official posts.
Such was the hatred of the people to the old regime that two
influential councillors of Charles the Bold, the Chancellor
Hugonet and the Sire d&rsquo;Humbercourt, having been discovered
in correspondence with the French king, were executed at
Ghent despite the tears and entreaties of the youthful duchess.
Mary now made her choice among the many suitors for her hand,
and selected the archduke Maximilian of Austria, afterwards
the emperor Maximilian I., and the marriage took place at
Ghent on the 18th of August 1477. Affairs now went more
smoothly in the Netherlands, the French aggression was checked,
and internal peace was in a large measure restored, when the
duchess met her death by a fall from her horse on the 27th of
March 1482. Three children had been the issue of her marriage,
and her elder son, Philip, succeeded to her dominions under the
guardianship of his father.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1496-1533), queen of France, was the daughter of
Henry VII. of England and Elizabeth of York. At first it was
intended to marry her to Charles of Austria, the future emperor
Charles V., and by the treaty of Calais (Dec. 21, 1507) it was
agreed that the marriage should take place when Charles should
have attained the age of fourteen, the contract being secured
by bonds taken from various princes and cities in the Low
Countries. On the 17th of December 1508 the Sieur de Bergues,
who had come over as Charles&rsquo;s representative at the head of
a magnificent embassy, married the princess by proxy. The
contract, originally made by Henry VII., was renewed on the
17th of October 1513 by Henry VIII. at a meeting with Margaret
of Savoy at Lille, the wedding being fixed for the following year.
But the emperor Maximilian I., to whom Louis XII. had proposed
his daughter Renée as wife for Charles, with Brittany for
dowry, postponed the match with the English princess in a way
that left no doubt of his intention to withdraw from the contract
altogether. He was forestalled by the diplomacy of Wolsey, at
whose instance peace was signed with France on the 7th of
August 1514, and on the same date a treaty was concluded for
the marriage of Mary Tudor with Louis XII., who had recently
lost his wife Anne of Brittany. The marriage was celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page825" id="page825"></a>825</span>
at Abbeville on the 9th of October. The bridegroom was a
broken man of fifty-two; the bride a beautiful, well-educated
and charming girl of eighteen, whose heart was already engaged
to Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, her future husband. The
political marriage was, however, no long one. Mary was crowned
queen of France on the 5th of November 1514; on the 1st of
January following King Louis died. Mary had only been induced
to consent to the marriage with Louis by the promise that, on
his death, she should be allowed to marry the man of her choice.
But there was danger that the agreement would not be kept.
In France the dukes of Lorraine and Savoy were mentioned as
possible suitors, and meanwhile the new king, Francis I., was
making advances to her, and only desisted when she confessed
to him her previous attachment to Suffolk. The duke himself
was at the head of the embassy which came from England to
congratulate the new king, and to the detriment of his political
mission he used the opportunity to win the hand of the queen.
Francis good-naturedly promised to use his influence in his
favour; Henry VIII. himself was not averse to the match, but
Mary feared the opposition of the lords of the council, and, in
spite of Suffolk&rsquo;s promise to the king not to take any steps in
the matter until after his return, she persuaded him to marry
her secretly before he left Paris. On their return to England
in April, Suffolk was for a while in serious danger from the king&rsquo;s
indignation, but was ultimately pardoned through Wolsey&rsquo;s
intercession, on payment of a heavy fine and the surrender of
all the queen&rsquo;s jewels and plate. The marriage was publicly
solemnized at Greenwich on the 13th of May 1515. Suffolk had
been already twice married, and his first wife was still alive.
He thought it necessary later on (1528) to obtain a bull from
Pope Clement VII. declaring his marriage with his first wife
invalid and his union with Mary therefore canonical. Mary&rsquo;s
life after this was comparatively uneventful. She lived mainly
in the retirement of the country, but shared from time to time
in the festivities of the court, and was present at the Field of
the Cloth of Gold. She died on the 24th of June 1533. By
the duke of Suffolk she had three children: Henry, born on the
11th of March 1516, created earl of Lincoln (1525), who died
young; Frances, born on the 16th of July 1517, the wife of Henry
Grey, marquess of Northampton, and mother of Lady Jane Grey
(<i>q.v.</i>); and Eleanor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY OF LORRAINE<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1515-1560), generally known as <span class="sc">Mary
of Guise</span>, queen of James V. and afterwards regent of Scotland,
was born at Bar on the 22nd of November 1515. She was the
eldest child of Claude of Guise and Antoinette of Bourbon, and
married in 1534 Louis II. of Orleans, duke of Longueville, to
whom in 1535 she bore a son, Francis (d. 1551). The duke died
in June 1537, and Mary was sought in marriage by James V.,
whose wife Magdalene died in July, and by Henry VIII. after
the death of Jane Seymour. Henry persisted in his offers after
the announcement of her betrothal to James V. Mary, who
was made by adoption a daughter of France, received a papal
dispensation for her marriage with James, which was celebrated
by proxy in Paris (May 1538) and at St Andrews on her arrival
in Scotland. Her two sons, James (b. May 1540) and Robert
or Arthur (b. April 1541), died within a few days of one another
in April 1541, and her husband died in December 1542, within
a week of the birth of his daughter and heiress, Mary, Queen of
Scots. Cardinal David Beton, the head of the French and
Catholic party and therefore Mary of Lorraine&rsquo;s friend and ally,
produced a will of the late king in which the primacy in the
regency was assigned to himself. John Knox accused the queen
of undue intimacy with Beton, and a popular report of a similar
nature, probably unfounded, was revived in 1543 by Sir Ralph
Sadler, the English envoy. Beton was arrested and the regency
fell to the heir presumptive James, earl of Arran, whose inclinations
were towards England and the Protestant party, and who
hoped to secure the hand of the infant princess for his own son.
Mary of Lorraine was approached by the English commissioner,
Sir Ralph Sadler, to induce her to further her daughter&rsquo;s marriage
contract with Edward VI. She informed Sadler that Arran had
asked her whether Henry had made propositions of marriage
to herself, and that she had stated that &ldquo;if Henry should mind
or offer her such an honour she must account herself much
bounden.&rdquo; Sadler further learnt that she was &ldquo;singularly well
affected to Henry&rsquo;s desires.&rdquo; The marriage treaty between
Mary, not then one year old, and Edward VI. was signed on the
1st of July at Greenwich, and guaranteed that Mary should be
placed in Henry&rsquo;s keeping when she was ten years old. The
queen dowager and her daughter were carefully watched at
Linlithgow, but on the 23rd of July 1543 they escaped, with
the help of Cardinal Beton, to the safer walls of Stirling castle.
After the queen&rsquo;s coronation in September Mary of Lorraine was
made principal member of the council appointed to direct the
affairs of the kingdom. She was constantly in communication
with her kinsmen in France, and was already planning to secure
for her daughter a French alliance, which was opposed on different
grounds by all her advisers. She made fresh alliances with the
earl of Angus and Sir George Douglas, and in 1544 she made a
premature attempt to seize the regency; but a reconciliation
with Arran was brought about by Cardinal Beton. The assassination
of Beton left her the cleverest politician in Scotland.
The English invasions of 1547, undertaken with a view to
enforcing the English marriage, gave Mary the desired pretext
for a French alliance. In June 1548 a French fleet, with
provisions and 5000 soldiers on board, under the command of
André de Montalembert, seigneur d&rsquo;Essé, landed at Leith to
reinforce the Scots army, and laid siege to Haddington, then
in the hands of the English. The Scottish parliament agreed
to the marriage of the young queen with the dauphin of France,
and, on the plea of securing her safety from English designs, she
set sail from Dumbarton in August 1548 to complete her
education at the French court.</p>

<p>Mary of Lorraine now gave her energies to the expulsion of
the English and to the difficult task of keeping the peace between
the Scots and their French auxiliaries. In September 1550 she
visited France and obtained from Henry II. the confirmation
of the dukedom and revenues of Châtelherault for the earl of
Arran, in the hope of inducing him to resign the regency. On
her way back to Scotland she was driven by storms to Portsmouth
harbour and paid a friendly visit to Edward VI. Arran
refused, however, to relinquish the regency until April 1554,
when he resigned after receiving an assurance of his rights to
the succession. The new regent had to deal with an empty
exchequer and with a strong opposition to her daughter&rsquo;s
marriage with the dauphin. The gift of high offices of state
to Frenchmen lent to the Protestant opposition the aspect of
a national resistance to foreign domination. The hostility of
Arran and his brother Archbishop Hamilton forced Mary into
friendly relations with the lords who favoured the Protestant
party. Soon after her marriage miners had been brought from
Lorraine to dig for gold at Crawford Moor, and she now carried
on successful mining enterprises for coal and lead, which enabled
her to meet the expenses of her government. In 1554 she took
into her service William Maitland of Lethington, who as secretary
of state gained very great influence over her. She also provoked
a dangerous enemy in John Knox by her expressed contempt
for a letter which he had written to her, but the first revolt
against her authority arose from an attempt to establish a
standing army. When she provoked a war with England in
1557 the nobles refused to cross the border. In matters of
religion she at first tried to hold the balance between the
Catholic and Protestant factions and allowed the Presbyterian
preachers the practice of their religion so long as they
refrained from public preachings in Edinburgh and Leith.
The marriage of Francis II. and her daughter Mary in 1558
strengthened her position, and in 1559 she relinquished her
conciliatory tactics to submit to the dictation of her relatives,
the Guises, by falling more into line with their religious
policy. She was reconciled with Archbishop Hamilton, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page826" id="page826"></a>826</span>
took up arms against the Protestants of Perth, who, incited
by Knox, had destroyed the Charterhouse, where many of the
Scottish kings were buried. The reformers submitted on condition
that no foreign garrison was to be imposed on Perth and
that the religious questions in dispute should be brought before
the Scottish parliament. Mary of Lorraine broke the spirit of
this agreement by garrisoning Perth with Scottish troops in
the pay of France. The lords of the Congregation soon assembled
in considerable force on Cupar Muir. Mary retreated to Edinburgh
and thence to Dunbar, while Edinburgh opened its gates
to the reformers, who issued a proclamation (Oct. 21, 1559)
claiming that the regent was deposed. The lords of the Congregation
sought help from Elizabeth, while the regent had
recourse to France, where an expedition under her brother,
René of Lorraine, marquis of Elbeuf, was already in preparation.
Mary, with the assistance of a French contingent, began to
fortify Leith. The strength of her opponents was increased by
the defection of Châtelherault and his son Arran; and an even
more serious danger was the treachery of her secretary Maitland,
who betrayed her plans to the lords of the Congregation. In
October 1559 they made an unsuccessful attack on Leith and
the seizure of an English convoy on the way to their army by
James Hepburn, earl of Bothwell, increased their difficulties.
Mary entered Edinburgh and conducted a campaign in Fife.
Meanwhile Maitland of Lethington had been at the English
court, and an English fleet under William Winter was sent to
the Forth in January 1560 to waylay Elbeuf&rsquo;s fleet, which was,
however, driven back by a storm to Calais. Elbeuf had been
commissioned by Francis I. and Mary to take over Mary&rsquo;s
regency on account of her failing health. An English army
under Lord Grey entered Scotland on the 29th of March 1560, and
the regent received an asylum in Edinburgh castle, which was
held strictly neutral by John Erskine. When she knew that she
was dying Mary sent for the lords of the Congregation, with
whom she pleaded for the maintenance of the French alliance.
She even consented to listen to the exhortations of the preacher
John Willock. She died on the 11th of June 1560. Her body
was taken to Reims and buried in the church of the nunnery
of St Peter, of which her sister was abbess.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY OF MODENA<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Maria Beatrice Anne Margaret
Isabel d&rsquo;Este</span>] (1658-1718), queen of the English king James
II., was the daughter of Alphonso IV., duke of Modena, and the
Duchess Laura, of the Roman family Martinozzi. She was born
at Modena on the 5th of October 1658. Her education was
strict, and her own wish was to be a nun in a convent of the
order of the Visitation founded by her mother. As a princess
she was not free to choose for herself, and was selected, mainly
by the king of France, Louis XIV., as the wife of James, duke
of York, heir-presumptive to the English throne. The duke
had become a Roman Catholic, and it was a point of policy
with the French king to provide him with a Roman Catholic
wife. Mary Beatrice of Este was chosen partly on the ground
of her known religious zeal, but also because of her beauty.
The marriage was celebrated by proxy on the 30th of September
1673. She reached England in November. In later life she
confessed that her first feelings towards her husband could only
be expressed by tears. In England the duchess, who was
commonly spoken of as Madam East, was supposed to be an
agent of the pope, who had indeed exerted himself to secure
her consent. Her beauty and her fine manners secured her the
respect of her brother-in-law, Charles II., and she lived on good
terms with her husband&rsquo;s daughters by his first marriage, but
she was always disliked by the nation. The birth of her first
son (who died in infancy) on the 16th of January 1675 was
regretted. During the Popish Plot, to which her secretary
Coleman was a victim, she went abroad with her husband.
After her husband&rsquo;s accession she suffered much domestic
misery through his infidelity. Her influence on him was
unfortunate, for she was a strong supporter of the Jesuit party
which was in favour of extreme measures. Her second son,
James Francis Edward, was born on the 10th of June (o.s.) 1688.
The public refused to believe that the baby was Mary&rsquo;s child,
and declared that a fraud had been perpetrated to secure a
Roman Catholic heir. When the revolution had broken out
she made the disastrous mistake of consenting to escape to
France (Dec. 10, 1688) with her son. She urged her husband
to follow her to France when it was his manifest interest to
stay in England, and when he went to Ireland she pressed
incessantly for his return. Her daughter, Louisa Maria, was
born at St Germain on the 28th of June 1692. When her
husband died on the 6th of September 1701, she succeeded
in inducing King Louis to recognize her son as king of England,
an act which precipitated the war of the Spanish Succession.
Queen Mary survived her husband for seventeen years and her
daughter for two. She received a pension of 100,000 crowns,
which was largely spent in supporting Jacobite exiles. At the
close of her life she had some success in obtaining payment of
her jointure. She lived at St Germain or at Chaillot, a religious
house of the Visitation. Her death occurred on the 7th of May
1718, and is said by Saint-Simon to have been that of a saint.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARY OF ORANGE<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1631-1660), eldest daughter of the
English king Charles I., was born in London on the 4th of
November 1631. Her father wished her to marry a son of
Philip IV., king of Spain, while her cousin, the elector palatine,
Charles Louis, was also a suitor for her hand, but both proposals
fell through and she became the wife of a Dutch prince, William,
son of Frederick Henry, prince of Orange. The marriage took
place in London on the 2nd of May 1641, but owing to the tender
years of the bride it was not consummated for several years.
However in 1642 Mary crossed over to Holland with her mother,
Queen Henrietta Maria, and in 1644, as the daughter-in-law of
the stadtholder, she began to take her place in public life. In
1647 her husband, William II., succeeded his father as stadtholder,
but three years later, just after his attempt to capture
Amsterdam, he died; a son, afterwards the English king William
III., being born to him a few days later (Nov. 14, 1650). Mary
was obliged to share the guardianship of her infant son with his
grandmother Amelia, the widow of Frederick Henry, and with
Frederick William, elector of Brandenburg; moreover, she was
unpopular with the Dutch owing to her sympathies with her
kinsfolk, the Stuarts, and at length public opinion having been
further angered by the hospitality which she showed to her
brothers, Charles II. and James, duke of York, she was forbidden
to receive her relatives. From 1654 to 1657 the princess passed
most of her time away from Holland. In 1657 she was appointed
regent on behalf of her son for the principality of Orange, but
the difficulties of her position led her to implore the assistance
of Louis XIV., and the French king answered by seizing Orange
himself. The position both of Mary and of her son in Holland
was greatly bettered through the restoration of Charles II. in
Great Britain. In September 1660 Mary journeyed to England.
She was taken ill of small-pox, and died in London on the 24th
of December 1660, her death, says Bishop Burnet, being &ldquo;not
much lamented.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARYBOROUGH,<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> a market town and the county town of

broad lowland east of the Slieve Bloom mountains, on the
river Triogue, an affluent of the Barrow, and on the main line
of the Great Southern &amp; Western railway, by which it is 51 m.
W.S.W. of Dublin. The town was chosen as county town
in the reign of Mary (1556), in whose honour both town and
county received their names. Its charter was granted in 1570,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page827" id="page827"></a>827</span>
but its present appearance, save a bastion of the ancient castle,
is wholly modern. There are flour-mills and a considerable
general trade. Maryborough returned two members to the
Irish parliament from 1585 until the union in 1800. The singular
lofty rock of Dunamase or Dunmall, about 3 m. from the town,
bears on its summit extensive ruins of a castle, originally
belonging to the kings of Leinster, but probably built in the
main by William Bruce (<i>c.</i> 1200) and dismantled in 1650 by
Cromwell&rsquo;s troops.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARYLAND,<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> a South Atlantic state of the United States,
and one of the original thirteen, situated between latitudes
37° 53&prime; and 39° 44&prime; N. and longitudes 75° 4&prime; and 79° 33&prime; W. (the
precise western boundary has not been determined). It is
bounded N. by Pennsylvania and Delaware; E. by Delaware and
the Atlantic Ocean; S. and W. by the Potomac river and its
north branch, which separate it, except on the extreme W.
border, from Virginia and West Virginia; W., also, by West
Virginia. It is one of the small states of the Union&mdash;only seven
are smaller&mdash;its total area being 12,327 sq. m. of which 2386
sq. m. are water surface.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;Maryland is crossed from north to south by
each of the leading topographical regions of the east section of the
United States&mdash;the Coastal Plain, the Piedmont Plateau, the
Appalachian Mountains, and the Appalachian Plateau&mdash;hence its
great diversity of surface. The portion within the Coastal Plain
embraces nearly the whole of the south-east half of the state and
is commonly known as tide-water Maryland. It is marked off
from the Piedmont Plateau by a &ldquo;Fall Line&rdquo; extending from
Washington (D.C.) north-east through Baltimore to a point a little
south of the north-east corner of the state, and is divided by the
Chesapeake Bay into two parts known as the East Shore and the
West Shore. The East Shore is a low level plain, the least elevated
section of the state. Along its entire Atlantic border extends
the narrow sandy Sinepuxent Beach, which encloses a shallow lagoon
or bay also called Sinepuxent at the north, where, except in the
extreme north, it is very narrow, and Chincoteague at the south,
where its width is in most places from 4 to 5 m. Between this and
the Chesapeake to the west and north-west there is a slight general
rise, a height of about 100 ft. being reached in the extreme north.
A water-parting extending from north-east to south-west and close
to the Atlantic border separates the East Shore into two drainage
systems, though that next to the Atlantic is insignificant. That
on the Chesapeake side is drained chiefly by the Pocomoke, Nanticoke,
Choptank and Chester rivers, together with their numerous
branches, the general direction of all of which is south-west. The
branches as well as the upper parts of the main streams flow through
broad and shallow valleys; the middle courses of the main streams
wind their way through reed-covered marshes, the water ebbing
and flowing with the tide; in their lower courses they become
estuarine and the water flows between low banks. The West Shore
is somewhat more undulating than the East and also more elevated.
Its general slope is from north-west to south-east; along the west
border are points 300 ft. or more in height. The principal rivers
crossing this section are the Patuxent, Patapsco and Gunpowder,
with which may be grouped the Potomac, forming the state&rsquo;s
southern boundary. These rivers, lined in most instances with
terraces 30 to 40 ft. high on one or both sides, flow south-east into
the Chesapeake Bay through valleys bounded by low hills. The
Fall Line, which forms the boundary between the Coastal Plain
and the Piedmont Plateau, is a zone in which a descent of about
100 ft. or more is made in many places within a few miles and in
consequence is marked by waterfalls, cascades and rapids.</p>

<p>The part of Maryland within the Piedmont Plateau extends
west from the Fall Line to the base of Catoctin Mountain, or the
west border of Frederick county, and has an area of about 2500
sq. m. In general it has a broad rolling surface. It is divided into
two sections by an elevated strip known as Parr&rsquo;s Ridge, which
extends from north-east to south-west a short distance west of the
middle. The east section rises from about 450 ft. along the Fall
Line to from 850 to 900 ft. along the summit of Parr&rsquo;s Ridge. Its
principal streams are those that cross the West Shore of the Coastal
Plain and here wind their way from Parr&rsquo;s Ridge rapidly toward
the south-east in narrow steep-sided gorges through broad limestone
valleys. To the west of Parr&rsquo;s Ridge the surface for the
most part slopes gently down to the east bank of the Monocacy
river (which flows nearly at a right angle with the streams east of
the Ridge), and then from the opposite bank rises rapidly toward
the Catoctin Mountain; but just above the mouth of the Monocacy
on the east side of the valley is Sugar Loaf Mountain, which makes
a steep ascent of 1250 ft.</p>

<p>The portion of the state lying within the Appalachian Region
is commonly known as Western Maryland. To the eastward it
abounds in mountains and valleys; to the westward it is a rolling
plateau. West of Catoctin Mountain (1800 ft.) is Middletown
Valley, with Catoctin Creek running through it from north to south,
and the Blue Ridge Mountains (2400 ft.), near the Pennsylvania
border, forming its west slope. Farther west the serrated crests
of the Blue Ridge overlook the Greater Appalachian Valley, here
73 m. in width, the broad gently-rolling slopes of the Great Cumberland
or Hagerstown Valley occupying its eastern and the Appalachian
Ridges its western portion. Through the eastern portion
Antietam Creek to the east and Conococheague Creek to the west
flow rapidly in meandering trenches that in places exceed 75 ft. in
depth. The Appalachian Ridges of the western portion begin with
North Mountain on the east and end with Wills Mountain on the
west. They are long, narrow, uniformly-sloping and level-crested
mountains, extending along parallel lines from north-east to south-west,
and reaching a maximum height in Martin&rsquo;s Ridge of more
than 2000 ft. Overlooking them from the west are the higher
ranges of the Alleghenies, among which the Savage, Backbone and
Negro Mountains reach elevations of 3000 ft. or more. In the
extreme west part of the state these mountains merge, as it were,
into a rolling plateau, the Appalachian Plateau, having an average
elevation of 2500 ft. All rivers of Western Maryland flow south
into the Potomac except in the extreme west, where the waters of
the Youghiogheny and its tributaries flow north into the Monongahela.</p>

<p><i>Fauna and Flora.</i>&mdash;In primitive times deer, ducks, turkeys, fish
and oysters were especially numerous, and wolves, squirrels and
crows were a source of annoyance to the early settlers. Deer,
black bears and wild cats (lynx) are still found in some uncultivated
sections. Much more numerous are squirrels, rabbits, &ldquo;groundhogs&rdquo;
(woodchucks), opossums, skunks, weasels and minks. Many
species of ducks are also still found; and the reed-bird (bobolink),
&ldquo;partridge&rdquo; (elsewhere called quail or &ldquo;Bob White&rdquo;), ruffed
grouse (elsewhere called partridge), woodcock, snipe, plover and
Carolina rail still abound. The waters of the Chesapeake Bay
are especially rich in oysters and crabs, and there, also, shad,
alewives, &ldquo;striped&rdquo; (commonly called &ldquo;rock&rdquo;) bass, menhaden,
white perch and weak-fish (&ldquo;sea-trout&rdquo;) occur in large numbers.
Among the more common trees are several species of oak, pine,
hickory, gums and maple, and the chestnut, the poplar, the beech,
the cypress and the red cedar; the merchantable pine has been cut,
but the chestnut and other hard woods of West Maryland are still
a product of considerable value. Among wild fruit-trees are the
persimmon and Chickasaw plum; grape-vines and a large variety
of berry-bushes grow wild and in abundance.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate of Maryland in the south-east is influenced
by ocean and bay&mdash;perhaps also by the sandy soil&mdash;while in the
west it is influenced by the mountains. The prevailing winds are
westerly; but generally north-west in winter in the west section
and south-west in summer in the south section. In the south the
normal winter is mild, the normal summer rather hot; in the west
the normal winter is cold, the normal summer cool. The normal
average annual temperature for the entire state is between 53° and
54° F., ranging from 48° at Grantsville in the north-west to 53° at
Darlington in the north-east, and to 57° at Princess Anne in the
south-east. The normal temperature for the state during July
(the warmest month) is 75.2° F., and during January (the coldest
month) 32.14° F. Although the west section is generally much
the cooler in summer, yet both of the greatest extremes recorded
since 1891 were at points not far apart in Western Maryland:
109° F. at Boettcherville and -26° F. at Sunnyside. The normal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page828" id="page828"></a>828</span>
annual precipitation for the state is about 43 in. It is greatest,
about 53 in., on the east slope of Catoctin Mountain, owing to the
elevations which obstruct the moisture-bearing winds, and is
above the average along the middle of the shores of the Chesapeake.
It is least, from 25 to 35 in., in the Greater Appalachian Valley, in
the south on the West Shore, and along the Atlantic border. During
spring and summer the precipitation throughout the state is about
2 in. more than during autumn and winter.</p>

<p><i>Soils and Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The great variety of soils is one of the
more marked features of Maryland. On the East Shore to the
north is a marly loam overlying a yellowish-red clay sub-soil, to
the south is a soil quite stiff with light coloured clay, while here
and there, especially in the middle and south, are considerable
areas both of light sandy soils and tidal marsh loams. On the
West Shore the soils range from a light sandy loam in the lower
levels south from Baltimore to rather heavy loams overlying a
yellowish clay on the rolling uplands and on the terraces along the
Potomac and Patuxent. Crossing the state along the lower edge
of the Fall Line is a belt heavy with clay, but so impervious to
water as to be of little value for agricultural purposes. The soils
of the Piedmont Plateau east of Parr&rsquo;s Ridge are, like the underlying
rocks, exceptionally variable in composition, texture and
colour. For the most part they are considerably heavier with
clay than are those of the Coastal Plain, and better adapted to
general agricultural purposes. Light loams, however, are found
both in the north-east and south-east. A soil of very close texture,
the gabbro, is found, most largely in the north-east. Alluvial
loams occupy the narrow river valleys; but the most common soil
of the section is that formed from gneiss with a large per cent. of
clay in the subsoil. West of Parr&rsquo;s Ridge in the Piedmont, the
principal soils are those the character of which is determined either
by decomposed red sandstone or by decomposed limestone. In
the east portion of the mountainous region the soil so well adapted
to peach culture contains much clay, together with particles of
Cambrian sandstone. In Hagerstown Valley are rich red or yellow
limestone-clay soils. The Allegheny ridges have only a thin
stony soil; but good limestone, sandstone, shale and alluvial soils,
occur in the valleys and in some of the plateaus of the extreme
west.</p>

<p>Of the total land surface of the state 82% was in 1900 included
in farms and 68% of the farmland was improved. There were
46,012 farms, of which 15,833 contained less than 50 acres, 3940
contained 260 acres or more, and 79 contained 1,000 acres or more&mdash;the
average size being 112.4 acres. In 1890, 69% of the farms
were worked by the owners or their managers, in 1900 only 66.4%;
but share tenants outnumber cash tenants by almost three to one.
Of the total number of farms about seven times as many are operated
by white as by negro farmers, though the number of farms operated
by white share tenants outnumber those operated by negro share
tenants by only about five to one. Of all the inhabitants of the
state, at least ten years old, who in 1900 were engaged in gainful
occupations, 20.8% were farmers. The leading agricultural pursuits
are the growing of Indian corn and wheat and the raising of
livestock, yet it is in the production of fruits, vegetables and
tobacco, that Maryland ranks highest as an agricultural state, and
in no other state except South Carolina is so large a per cent. of the
value of the crop expended for fertilizers. In 1907, according to
the <i>Year Book</i> of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Indian
corn crop was 22,196,000 bushels, valued at $11,986,000; the wheat
crop was 14,763,000 bushels, valued at $14,172,000; the oat crop
was 825,000 bushels, valued at $404,000; and the crop of rye was
315,000 bushels, valued at $236,000. Of the livestock, hogs were
the most numerous in 1900, cattle next, sheep third, and horses
fourth. The hay and forage crop of 1899 (exclusive of corn-stalks)
grew on 374,848 acres. Until after the middle of the 18th century
tobacco was the staple crop of Maryland, and the total yield did
not reach its maximum until 1860 when the crop amounted to
51,000 hhds.; from this it decreased to 14,000 hhds., or 12,356,838 &#8468;
in 1889; in 1899 it rose again to 24,589,480 &#8468;, in 1907 the crop
was only 16,962,000 &#8468;, less than that of nine other states. In
market-garden products, including small fruits, Maryland ranked
in 1899 sixth among the states of the Union, the crop being valued
at $4,766,760, an increase of 350.9% over that of 1889. In the
yield both of strawberries and of tomatoes it ranked first; the yield
of raspberries and blackberries is also large. In its crop of green-peas
Maryland was exceeded (1899) by New York only; in sweet
Indian corn it ranked fifth; in kale, second; in spinach, third; in
cabbages, ninth. The number of peach-trees, especially in the
west part of the state, where the quality is of the best, is rapidly
increasing, and in the yield of peaches and nectarines the state
ranked thirteenth in 1899; in the yield of pears it ranked fifth; in
apples seventeenth.</p>

<p>The Indian-corn, wheat and livestock sections of the state, are
in the Piedmont Plateau, the Hagerstown Valley and the central
portion of the East Shore. Garrett county in the extreme north-west,
however, raises the largest number of sheep. Most of the
tobacco is grown in the south counties of the West Shore. The
great centre for vegetables and small fruits is in the counties bordering
on the north-west shore of the Chesapeake, and in Howard,
Frederick and Washington counties, directly west, Anne Arundel
county producing the second largest quantity of strawberries of
all the counties in the Union in 1899. Peaches and pears grow in
large quantities in Kent and neighbouring counties on the East
Shore and in Washington and Frederick counties; apples grow in
abundance in all parts of the Piedmont Plateau.</p>

<p>The woodland area of the state in 1900 was 4400 sq. m., about
44% (estimated in 1907 to be 3450 sq. m., about 35%) of the
total land area, but with the exception of considerable oak and chestnut,
some maple and other hard woods in west Maryland, about
all of the merchantable timber has been cut. The lumber industry,
nevertheless, has steadily increased in importance, the value of
the product in 1860 amounting to only $605,864, that in 1890 to
$1,600,472, and that in 1900 to $2,650,082, of which sum $2,495,169
was the value of products under the factory system; in 1905 the value
of the factory product was $2,750,339.</p>

<p><i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;In 1897 the value of the fishery product of Maryland
was exceeded only by that of Massachusetts, but by 1901, although
it had increased somewhat during the four years, it was exceeded
by the product of New Jersey, of Virginia and of New York. Oysters
constitute more than 80% of the total value, the product in 1901
amounting to 5,685,561 bushels, and being valued at $3,031,518.
The supply on natural beds has been diminishing, but the planting
of private beds promises a large increase. Crabs are next in value
and are caught chiefly along the East Shore and in Anne Arundel
and Calvert counties on the West Shore. Shad, to the number of
3,111,181 and valued at $120,602, were caught during 1901. In
Somerset and Worcester counties clams are a source of considerable
value. The terrapin catch decreased in value from $22,333 in 1891
to $1,139 in 1901. The total value of the fish product of 1901 was
$3,767,461. The state laws for the protection of fish and shell-fish
were long carelessly enforced because of the fishermen&rsquo;s strong
feeling against them, but this sentiment has slowly changed and
enforcement has become more vigorous.</p>

<p><i>Minerals and Manufactures.</i>&mdash;The coal deposits, which form a
part of the well-known Cumberland field, furnish by far the most
important mineral product of the state; more than 98% of this,
in 1901, was mined in Allegany county from a bed about 20 m. long
and 5 m. wide and the remainder in Garrett county, whose deposits,
though undeveloped, are of great value. The coal is of two varieties:
bituminous and semi-bituminous. The bituminous is of excellent
quality for the manufacture of coke and gas, but up to 1902 had
been mined only in small quantities. Most of the product has
been of the semi-bituminous variety and of the best quality in
the country for the generation of steam. Nearly all the high
grade blacksmithing coal mined in the United States comes from
Maryland. The deposits were discovered early in the 19th century
(probably first in 1804 near the present Frostburg), but were not
exploited until railway transport became available in 1842, and
the output was not large until after the close of the Civil War; in
1865 it was 1,025,208 short tons, from which it steadily increased
to 5,532,628 short tons in 1907. From 1722 until the War of
Independence the iron-ore product of North and West Maryland
was greater than that of any of the other colonies, but since then
ores of superior quality have been discovered in other states and
the output in Maryland, taken chiefly from the west border of the
Coastal Plain in Anne Arundel and Prince George&rsquo;s counties, has
become comparatively of little importance&mdash;24,367 long tons in 1902
and only 8269 tons in 1905. Gold, silver and copper ores, have
been found in the state, and attempts have been made to mine
them, without much success. The Maryland building stone, of
which there is an abundance of good quality, consists chiefly of
granites, limestones, slate, marble and sandstones, the greater part
of which is quarried in the east section of the Piedmont Plateau
especially in Cecil county, though some limestones, including those
from which hydraulic cement is manufactured, and some sandstones
are obtained from the western part of the Piedmont Plateau
and the east section of the Appalachian region; the value of stone
quarried in the state in 1907 was $1,439,355, of which $1,183,753
was the value of granite, $142,825 that of limestone, $98,918 that
of marble, and $13,859 that of sandstone. Brick, potter&rsquo;s and
tile clays are obtained most largely along the west border of the
Coastal Plain, and fire-clay from the coal region of West Maryland;
in 1907 the value of clay products was $1,886,362. Materials for
porcelain, including flint, feldspar and kaolin, abound in the east
portion of the Piedmont, the kaolin chiefly in Cecil county, and
material for mineral paint in Anne Arundel and Prince George&rsquo;s
counties, as well as farther north-west.</p>

<p class="pt2">Between 1850 and 1900, while the population increased 103.8%,
the average number of wage-earners employed in manufacturing
establishments increased 258.5%, constituting 5.2% of the total
population in 1850 and 9.1% in 1900. In 1900 the total value of
manufactured goods was $242,552,990, an increase of 41.1% over
that of 1890. Of the total given for 1900, $211,076,143 was the
value of products under the factory system; and in 1905 the value
of factory products was $243,375,996, being 15.3% more than in
1900. The products of greatest value in 1905 were: custom-made
men&rsquo;s clothing; fruits and vegetables and oysters, canned and
preserved; iron and steel; foundry and machine-shop products,
including stoves and furnaces; flour and grist mill products; tinware,
coppersmithing and sheet iron working; fertilizers; slaughtering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page829" id="page829"></a>829</span>
and meat-packing; cars and repairs by steam railways; shirts;
cotton goods; malt liquors; and cigars and cigarettes. In the
value of fertilizers manufactured, and in that of oysters canned
and preserved, Maryland was first among the states in 1900 and
second in 1905; in 1900 and in 1905 it was fourth among the states
in the value of men&rsquo;s clothing. Baltimore is still the great manufacturing
centre, but of the state&rsquo;s total product the percentage
in value of that manufactured there decreased from 82.5 in 1890
to 66.5 in 1900, and to 62.3 (of the factory product) in 1905. The
largest secondary centres are Cumberland, Hagerstown and Frederick
the total value of whose factory products in 1905 was less than
$10,000,000.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Tide-water Maryland is afforded rather unusual
facilities of water transportation by the Chesapeake Bay, with its
deep channel, numerous deep inlets and navigable tributaries,
together with the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which crosses
the state of Delaware and connects its waters with those of the
Delaware river and bay. As early as 1783 steps were taken to
extend these facilities to the navigable waters of the Ohio, chiefly
by improving the navigation of the Potomac above Georgetown.
By 1820 this project was merged into a movement for a Chesapeake
and Ohio canal along the same line. Ground was broken in 1828
and in 1850 the canal was opened to navigation from Georgetown
to Cumberland, a distance of 186 m. In 1878 and again in 1889 it
was wrecked by a freshet, and since then has been of little service.<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
However, on the same day that ground was broken for this canal,
ground was also broken for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railway, of which
15 m. was built in 1828-1830 and which was one of the first steam
railway lines in operation in the United States. Since then railway
building has progressed steadily. In Maryland (and including the
District of Columbia) there were 259 m. of railway in 1850, 386 m.
in 1860, 671 m. in 1870, and 1040 m. in 1880; in 1890, in Maryland
alone, the mileage was 1270.04 m., and in 1909 it was 1394.19 m.
The more important railway lines are the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, the
Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp; Washington (controlled by the Pennsylvania
and a consolidation of the Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp;
Baltimore, and the Baltimore &amp; Potomac), the Western Maryland,
the West Virginia Central &amp; Pittsburg (leased by the Western
Maryland), the Northern Central, the Maryland electric railways
(including what was formerly the Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Short
Line), and the Washington, Baltimore &amp; Annapolis electric railway.
Baltimore is the chief railway centre and its harbour is one of the
most important in the country.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The population of Maryland in 1880 was 934,943;
in 1890, 1,042,390, an increase of 11.5%; in 1900, 1,188,044
(14%); in 1910, 1,295,346 (increase 9%).<a name="fa2o" id="fa2o" href="#ft2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Of the total
population in 1900 there were 952,424 whites, 235,064 negroes,
544 Chinese, 9 Japanese and 3 Indians, the increase in the white
population from 1890 to 1900 being 15.2%, while that of the
negroes was only 9%. In 1900 there were 1,094,110 native
born to 93,934 foreign-born, and of the foreign-born 44,990 were
natives of Germany and 68,600 were residents of the city of
Baltimore. The urban population, <i>i.e.</i> total population of cities
of 4000 or more inhabitants, in 1900, was 572,795, or 48.2% of
the total and an increase of 16.6% over that of 1890; while the
rural population, <i>i.e.</i> population outside of incorporated places,
was 539,685, an increase of about 8% over that of 1890. There
are about 59 religious sects, of which the members of the Roman
Catholic Church, which was prominent in the early history of
Maryland, are far the most numerous, having in 1906 166,941
members out of 473,257 communicants of all denominations;
in the same year there were 137,156 Methodists, 34,965 Protestant
Episcopalians, 32,246 Lutherans, 30,928 Baptists, 17,895
Presbyterians and 13,442 members of the Reformed Church in
the United States. The chief cities are Baltimore, pop. (1910)
558,485, Cumberland 21,839, Hagerstown 16,507, Frederick
10,411 and Annapolis 8609.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;The state constitution of 1867, the one now in
force, has been frequently amended, all that is required for its
amendment being a three-fifths vote of all of the members
elected to each of the two houses of the General Assembly, followed
by a majority vote of the state electorate, and it is further
provided that once in twenty years, beginning with 1887, the
wish of the people in regard to calling a convention for altering
the constitution shall be ascertained by a poll. Any constitution
or constitutional amendment proposed by such constitutional
convention comes into effect only if approved by a majority of
the votes cast in a popular election. Since 1870 suffrage has
been the right of all male citizens (including negroes) twenty-one
years of age or over who shall have lived within the state for one
year and within the county or the legislative district of the city
of Baltimore in which they may offer to vote for six months
immediately preceding an election; persons convicted of larceny
or other infamous crime and not since pardoned by the governor,
as well as lunatics or those who have been convicted of bribery
at a previous election are excepted. In 1908 the General
Assembly passed a law providing for annual direct primary
elections (outside of Baltimore; and making the Baltimore
special primary law applicable to state as well as city officials),
but, as regards state officers, making only a slight improvement
upon previous conditions inasmuch as the county or district
is the unit and the vote of county or district merely &ldquo;instructs&rdquo;
delegates to the party&rsquo;s state nominating convention, representation
in which is not strictly in proportion to population, the
rural counties having an advantage over Baltimore; no nomination
petition is required. In the same year a separate law was
passed providing for primary elections for the choice of United
States senators; but here also the method is not that of nomination
by a plurality throughout the state, but by the vote of
counties and legislative districts, so that this measure, like the
other primary law, is not sufficiently direct to give Baltimore a
vote proportional to its population.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief executive authority is vested in a governor elected by
popular vote for a term of four years. Since becoming a state Maryland
has had no lieutenant-governor except under the constitution
of 1864; and the office of governor is to be filled in case of a vacancy
by such person as the General Assembly may elect.<a name="fa3o" id="fa3o" href="#ft3o"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Any citizen
of Maryland may be elected to the office who is thirty years of age
or over, who has been for ten years a citizen of the state, who has
lived in the state for five years immediately preceding election, and
who is at the time of his election a qualified voter therein. Until
1838 the governor had a rather large appointing power, but since
that date most of the more important offices have been filled by
popular election. He, however, still appoints, subject to the
confirmation of the senate, the secretary of state, the superintendent
of public education, the commissioner of the land office, the adjutant-general,
justices of the peace, notaries public, the members of
numerous administrative boards, and other administrative officers.
He is himself one of the board of education, of the board of public
works, and of the board for the management of the house of correction.
No veto power whatever was given to the governor until
1867, when, in the present constitution, it was provided that no bill
vetoed by him should become a law unless passed over his veto by
a three-fifths vote of the members elected to each house, and an
amendment of 1890 (ratified by the people in 1891) further provides
that any item of a money bill may likewise be separately vetoed.
The governor&rsquo;s salary is fixed by the constitution at $4500 a year.
Other executive officers are a treasurer, elected by joint ballot of
the General Assembly for a term of two years, a comptroller elected
by popular vote for a similar term, and an attorney-general elected
by popular vote for four years.</p>

<p>The legislature, or General Assembly, meets biennially in even-numbered
years, at Annapolis, and consists of a Senate and a House
of Delegates. Senators are elected, one from each of the twenty-three
counties and one from each of the four legislative districts of
the city of Baltimore, for a term of four years, the terms of one-half
expiring every two years. Delegates are elected for a term of two
years, from each county and from each legislative district of
Baltimore, according to population, as follows: for a population of
18,000 or less, two delegates; 18,000 to 28,000, three; 28,000 to
40,000, four; 40,000 to 55,000, five; 55,000 and upwards, six. Each
legislative district of Baltimore is entitled to the number of delegates
to which the largest county shall or may be entitled under the
foregoing apportionment, and the General Assembly may from
time to time alter the boundaries of Baltimore city districts in order
to equalize their population. This system of apportionment gives
to the rural counties a considerable political advantage over the
city of Baltimore, which, with 42.8% of the total population
according to the census of 1900, has only 4 out of 27 members of
the Senate and only 24 out of 101 members of the House of Delegates.
Since far back in the colonial era, no minister, preacher, or priest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page830" id="page830"></a>830</span>
has been eligible to a seat in either house. A senator must be twenty-five
years of age or over, and both senators and delegates must have
lived within the state at least three years and in their county or
legislative district at least one year immediately preceding their
election.</p>

<p>The constitution provides that no bill or joint resolution shall pass
either house except by an affirmative vote of a majority of all the
members elected to that house and requires that on the final vote
the yeas and nays be recorded.</p>

<p><i>Justice, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The administration of justice is entrusted to a
court of appeals, circuit courts, special courts for the city of Baltimore,
orphans&rsquo; courts, and justices of the peace. Exclusive of the
city of Baltimore, the state is divided into seven judicial circuits,
in each of which are elected for a term of fifteen years one chief judge
and two associate judges, who at the time of their election must be
members of the Maryland bar, between the ages of thirty and seventy,
and must have been residents of the state for at least five years.
The seven chief judges so elected, together with one elected from
the city of Baltimore, constitute the court of appeals, the governor
with the advice and consent of the senate designating one of the
eight as chief judge of that court. The court has appellate jurisdiction
only. The three judges elected in each circuit constitute the
circuit court of each of the several counties in such circuit. The
courts have both original and appellate jurisdiction and are required
to hold at least two sessions to which jurors shall be summoned
every year in each county of its circuit, and if only two such terms
are held, there must be two other and intermediate terms to which
jurors shall not be summoned. Three other judges are elected for
four-year terms, in each county and in the city of Baltimore to
constitute an orphans&rsquo; court. The number of justices of the peace
for each county is fixed by local law; they are appointed by the
governor, subject to the confirmation of the Senate, for a term of
two years.</p>

<p>In the colonial era Maryland had an interesting list of governmental
subdivisions&mdash;the manor, the hundred, the parish, the county, and
the city&mdash;but the two last are about all that remain and even these
are in considerable measure subject to the special local acts of the
General Assembly. In general, each county has from three to
seven commissioners&mdash;the number is fixed by county laws&mdash;elected
on a general ticket of each county for a term of from two to six
years, entrusted with the charge and control of property owned by
the county, empowered to appoint constables, judges of elections,
collectors of taxes, trustees of the poor, and road supervisors, to
levy taxes, to revise taxable valuations of real property, and open
or close public roads.</p>

<p>In Maryland a wife holds her property as if single except that she
can convey real estate only by a joint deed with her husband (this requirement
being for the purpose of effecting a release of the husband&rsquo;s
&ldquo;dower interest&rdquo;), neither husband nor wife is liable for the separate
debts of the other, and on the death of either the rights of the survivor
in the estate of the other are about equal. Wife-beating is made
punishable by whipping in gaol, not exceeding forty lashes. Prior
to 1841 a divorce was granted by the legislature only, from then
until 1851 it could be granted by either the legislature or the equity
courts, since 1851 by the courts only. The grounds for a divorce
<i>a mensa et thoro</i>, which may be granted for ever or for a limited time
only, are cruelty, excessively vicious conduct, or desertion; for a
divorce <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i> the chief grounds are impotence at
the time of marriage, adultery or deliberate abandonment for three
years. There is no homestead exemption law and exemptions from
levy for the satisfaction of debts extend only to $100 worth of
property, besides wearing apparel and books and tools used by the
debtor in his profession or trade, and to all money payable in the
nature of insurance. Employers of workmen in a clay or coal mine,
stone quarry, or on a steam or street railway are liable for damage
in case of an injury to any of their workmen where such injury is
caused by the negligence of the employer or of any servant or
employee of the employer. The chief of the bureau of labour
statistics is directed in case of danger of a strike or lockout to seek
to mediate between the parties and if unsuccessful in that, then to
endeavour to secure their consent to the formation of a board of
arbitration.</p>

<p>The state penal and charitable institutions include a penitentiary
at Baltimore; a house of correction at Jessups, two houses of
refuge at Baltimore; a house of reformation in Prince George&rsquo;s
county; St Mary&rsquo;s industrial school for boys at Baltimore; an
industrial home for negro girls at Melvale; an asylum and training
school for the feeble-minded at Owings Mills; an infirmary at
Cumberland; the Maryland hospital for the insane at Catonsville;
the Springfield state hospital for the insane; the Maryland school
for the deaf and dumb at Frederick city; and the Maryland school
for the blind at Baltimore. Each of these is under the management
of a board appointed by the governor subject to the confirmation
of the senate. Besides these there are a large number of state-aided
charitable institutions. In 1900 there was created a board
of state aid and charities, composed of seven members appointed
by the governor for a term of two years, not more than four to be
reappointed. There is also a state lunacy commission of four
members, who are appointed for terms of four years, one annually,
by the governor.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;The basis of the present common school system was
laid in 1865, after which a marked development was accompanied
by some important changes in the system and its administration,
and the percentage of total illiteracy (<i>i.e.</i> inability to write among
those ten years old and over) decreased from 19.3 in 1800 to 11.1
in 1900, while illiteracy among the native whites decreased during
the same period from 7.8 to 4.1 and among negroes from 59.6 to 35.2.
At the head of the system is a state board and a state superintendent,
and under these in each county is a county board which appoints
a superintendent for the county and a board of trustees for each
school district none of which is to be more than four miles square.
The state board is composed of the governor as its president, the
state superintendent as its secretary, six other members appointed
by the governor for a term of six years, and, as <i>ex-officio</i> members
without the right to vote, the principals of the state and other
normal schools. Prior to 1900 the principal of the state normal
was <i>ex-officio</i> state superintendent, but since then the superintendent
has been appointed by the governor for a term of four years. Each
county board is also appointed by the governor for a term of six
years. In both the state and the county boards at least one-third
of the members appointed by the governor are not to be of the
dominant political party and only one-third of the members are to
be appointed every two years. The state board enacts by-laws
for the administration of the system; its decision of controversies
arising under the school law is final; it may suspend or remove a
county superintendent for inefficiency or incompetency; it issues
life state certificates, but applicants must have had seven years of
experience in teaching, five in Maryland, and must hold a first-class
certificate or a college or normal school diploma; and it pensions
teachers who have taught successfully for twenty-five years in any
of the public or normal schools of the state, who have reached the
age of sixty, and who have become physically or mentally incapable
of teaching longer, the pension amounting to $200 a year. The
legislature of 1908 passed a law under which the minimum pay for
a teacher holding a first-class certificate should be $350 a year after
three years&rsquo; teaching, $400 after five years&rsquo; teaching and $450 after
eight years&rsquo; teaching. By a law of 1904 all teachers who taught
an average of 15 pupils were to receive at least $300. School books
are purchased out of the proceeds of the school tax, but parents may
purchase if they prefer. In 1908 the average school year was nine
and seven-tenths months&mdash;ten in the cities and nine and four-tenths
in the counties; the aim is ten months throughout, and a law of
1904 provides that if a school is taught less than nine months a
portion of the funds set apart for it shall be withheld. A compulsory
education law of 1902&mdash;to operate, however, only in the city of
Baltimore and in Allegany county&mdash;requires the attendance for
the whole school year of children between the ages of eight and twelve
and also of those between the ages of twelve and sixteen who are
not employed at home or elsewhere. A separate school for negro
children is to be maintained in every election district in which the
population warrants it. The system is maintained by a state tax
of 16 cents on each $100 of taxable property.</p>

<p>The higher state educational institutions are two normal schools
and one agricultural college. One of the normal schools was opened
in Baltimore in 1866, the other at Frostburg in 1904. Both are under
the management of the state Board of Education, which appoints
the principals and teachers and prescribes the course of study.
There is besides, in Washington College at Chestertown, a normal
department supported by the state and under the supervision of
the state Board of Education. The Maryland Agricultural College,
to which an experiment station has been added, was opened in 1859;
it is at College Park in Prince George&rsquo;s county, and is largely under
state management. Maryland supports no state university, but
Johns Hopkins University, one of the leading institutions of its
kind in the country, receives $25,000 a year from the state; the
medical department of the university of Maryland receives an
annual appropriation of about $2500, and St John&rsquo;s College, the
academic department of the university of Maryland, receives from
the state $13,000 annually and gives for each county in the state
one free scholarship and one scholarship covering all expenses.
Among the principal institutions in the state are the university
of Maryland, an outgrowth of the medical college of Maryland
(1807) in Baltimore, with a law school (reorganized in 1869), a
dental school (1882), a school of pharmacy (1904), and, since 1907,
a department of arts and science in St John&rsquo;s College (non-sect.,
opened in 1789) at Annapolis; Washington College, with a normal
department (non-sect., opened in 1782) at Chestertown; Mount
St Mary&rsquo;s College (Roman Catholic, 1808) at Emmitsburg; New
Windsor College (Presbyterian, 1843) at New Windsor; St Charles
College (Roman Catholic, opened in 1848) and Rock Hill College
(Roman Catholic, 1857) near Ellicott City; Loyola College (Roman
Catholic, 1852) at Baltimore; Western Maryland College (Methodist
Protestant, 1867) at Westminster; Johns Hopkins University (non-sect.,
1876) at Baltimore; Morgan College (coloured, Methodist,
1876) at Baltimore; Goucher College (Methodist, founded 1884,
opened 1888) at Baltimore; several professional schools mostly
in Baltimore (<i>q.v.</i>); the Peabody Institute at Baltimore; and the
United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.</p>

<p><i>Revenue.</i>&mdash;The state&rsquo;s revenue is derived from a general direct
property tax, a licence tax, corporation taxes, a collateral inheritance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page831" id="page831"></a>831</span>
tax, fines, forfeitures and fees; and the penitentiary yields an annual
net revenue of about $40,000. There is no provision for a general
periodic assessment, but a state tax commissioner appointed by the
governor, treasurer and comptroller assesses the corporations, and
the county commissioners (in the counties) and the appeal tax court
(in the city of Baltimore) revise valuations of real property every
two years. From 1820 to 1836 Maryland, in its enthusiasm over
internal improvements, incurred an indebtedness of more than
$16,000,000. To meet the interest, such heavy taxes were levied
that anti-tax associations were formed to resist the collection, and
in 1842 the state failed to pay what was due; but the accumulated
interest had been funded by 1848 and was paid soon afterwards,
the expenses of the government were curtailed by the constitution
of 1851, and after the Civil War the amount of indebtedness steadily
decreased until in 1902 the funded debt was $6,909,326 and the net
debt only $2,797,269.13, while on the 1st of October 1908 the net
debt was $366,643.91. As a result of incurring the large debt, a
clause in the constitution prohibits the legislature from contracting
a debt without providing by the imposition of taxes for the payment
of the interest annually and the principal within fifteen years, except
to meet a temporary deficiency not exceeding $50,000. The first
bank of the state was established in 1790, and by 1817 there was one
in each of twelve counties and several in Baltimore; in 1818-1820
and in 1837-1839 there were several serious bank failures, but
there have been no serious failures since. A constitutional provision
makes each stockholder in a state bank liable to the amount of his
share or shares for all the bank&rsquo;s debts and liabilities. A savings bank
is taxed on its deposits, and a state bank is taxed on its capital-stock.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of Maryland begins in 1632 with the
procedure of Charles I. to grant a charter conveying almost
unlimited territorial and governmental rights therein to George
Calvert, first Lord Baltimore (1580?-1632), and styling him its
absolute lord and proprietor. George Calvert died before the
charter had passed the great seal, but about two months later
in the same year it was issued to his eldest son, Cecilius. In
November 1633 two vessels, the &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dove,&rdquo;
carrying at least two hundred colonists under Leonard Calvert
(<i>c.</i> 1582-1647), a brother of the proprietor, as governor, sailed
from Gravesend and arrived in Maryland late in March of the
following year. Friendly relations were at the outset established
with the Indians, and the province never had much trouble
with that race; but with William Claiborne (1589?-1676?), the
arch-enemy of the province as long as he lived, it was otherwise.
He had opposed the grant of the Maryland charter, had established
a trading post on Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay in 1631,
and when commanded to submit to the new government he and
his followers offered armed resistance. A little later, during his
temporary absence in England, his followers on the island were
reduced to submission; but in 1644, while the Civil War in
England was in progress, he was back in the province assisting
Richard Ingle, a pirate who claimed to be acting in the interest
of parliament, in raising an insurrection which deprived Governor
Calvert of his office for about a year and a half. Finally, the
lord proprietor was deprived of his government from 1654 to
1658 in obedience to instructions from parliament which were
originally intended to affect only Virginia, but were so modified,
through the influence of Claiborne and some Puritan exiles from
Virginia who had settled in Maryland, as to apply also to &ldquo;the
plantations within Chesapeake Bay.&rdquo; Then the long continued
unrest both in the mother country and in the province seems to
have encouraged Josias Fendall, the proprietor&rsquo;s own appointee
as governor, to strike a blow against the proprietary government
and attempt to set up a commonwealth in its place; but this revolt
was easily suppressed and order was generally preserved in the
province from the English Restoration of 1660 to the English
Revolution of 1688.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an interesting internal development had been in
progress. The proprietor was a Roman Catholic and probably it
was his intention that Maryland should be an asylum for persecuted
Roman Catholics, but it is even more clear that he was
desirous of having Protestant colonists also. To this end he
promised religious toleration from the beginning and directed
his officers accordingly; this led to the famous toleration act
passed by the assembly in 1649, which, however, extended its
protection only to sects of Trinitarian Christianity. Again,
although the charter reserved to the proprietor the right of
calling an assembly of the freemen or their delegates at such
times and in such form and manner as he should choose, he surrendered
in 1638 his claim to the sole right of initiating legislation.
By 1650 the assembly had been divided into two houses, in one of
which sat only the representatives of the freemen without whose
consent no bill could become a law, and annual sessions as well
as triennial elections were coming to be the usual order. When
suffrage had thus come to be a thing really worth possessing,
the proprietor, in 1670, sought to check the opposition by disfranchising
all freemen who did not have a freehold of fifty acres
or a visible estate of forty pounds sterling. But this step was
followed by more and more impassioned complaints against
him, such as: that he was interfering with elections, that he was
summoning only a part of the delegates elected, that he was
seeking to overawe those summoned, that he was abusing his veto
power, and that he was keeping the government in the hands of
Roman Catholics, who were mostly members of his own family.
About this time also the north and east boundaries of the province
were beginning to suffer from the aggressions of William Penn.
The territory now forming the state of Delaware was within the
boundaries defined by the Maryland charter, but in 1682 it was
transferred by the duke of York to William Penn and in 1685
Lord Baltimore&rsquo;s claim to it was denied by an order in council,
on the ground that it had been inhabited by Christians before
the Maryland charter was granted. In the next place, although
it was clear from the words of the charter that the parallel of
40° N. was intended for its north boundary, and although Penn&rsquo;s
charter prescribed that Pennsylvania should extend on the south
to the &ldquo;beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude,&rdquo;
a controversy arose with regard to the boundary between the
two provinces, and there was a long period of litigation; in 1763-1767
Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, two English mathematicians,
established the line named from them (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mason and
Dixon Line</a></span>), which runs along the parallel 39° 43&prime; 26&Prime;.3 N. and
later became famous as the dividing line between the free states
and the slave states. While the proprietor was absent defending
his claims against Penn the English Revolution of 1688 was
started. Owing to the death of a messenger there was long delay
in proclaiming the new monarchs in Maryland; this delay, together
with a rumor of a Popish plot to slaughter the Protestants,
enabled the opposition to overthrow the proprietary government,
and then the crown, in the interest of its trade policy, set up a
royal government in its place, in 1692, without, however, divesting
the proprietor of his territorial rights. Under the royal
government the Church of England was established, the people
acquired a strong control of their branch of the legislature and
they were governed more by statute law and less by executive
ordinance. The proprietor having become a Protestant, the
proprietary government was restored in 1715. Roman Catholics
were disfranchised immediately afterward. In 1730 Germans
began to settle in considerable numbers in the west-central part
of the colony, where they greatly promoted its industrial development
but at the same time added much strength to the opposition.
The first great dispute between proprietor and people after
the restoration of 1715 was with regard to the extension of the
English statutes to Maryland, the popular branch of the legislature
vigorously contending that all such statutes except those
expressly excluded extended to the province, and the lord proprietor
contending that only those in which the dominions were
expressly mentioned were in force there. Many other disputes
speedily followed and when the final struggle between the English
and French for possession in America came, although appropriations
were made at its beginning to protect her own west
frontier from the attacks of the enemy, a dead-lock between the
two branches of the assembly prevented Maryland from responding
to repeated appeals from the mother country for aid in the
latter part of that struggle. This failure was used as an argument
in favour of imposing the famous Stamp Act. Nevertheless,
popular clamour against parliament on account of that measure
was even greater than it had been against the proprietor. The
stamp distributor was driven out, and the arguments of Daniel
Dulany (1721-1797), the ablest lawyer in the province, against
the act were quoted by speakers in parliament for its repeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page832" id="page832"></a>832</span></p>

<p>In the years immediately preceding the Declaration of Independence
Maryland pursued much the same course as did other
leading colonies in the struggle&mdash;a vessel with tea on board was
even burned to the water&rsquo;s edge&mdash;and yet when it came to the
decisive act of declaring independence there was hesitation. As
the contest against the proprietor had been nearly won, the
majority of the best citizens desired the continuance of the old
government and it was not until the Maryland delegates in the
Continental Congress were found almost alone in holding back
that their instructions not to vote for independence were
rescinded. The new constitution drawn and adopted in 1776 to
take the place of the charter was of an aristocratic rather than
a democratic nature. Under it the property qualification for
suffrage was a freehold of 50 acres or £30 current money, the
property qualifications for delegates £500, for senators £1000,
and for governor £5000. Four delegates were chosen from each
county and two each from Baltimore and Annapolis, the same
as under the proprietary government, population not being taken
into account. Senators were chosen by a college of fifteen
electors elected in the same manner as the delegates, and the
governor by a joint ballot of the two houses of assembly. In
1802 negroes were disfranchised, and in 1810 property qualifications
for suffrage and office were abolished. The system of
representation that, with the rapid growth of population in the
north-east sections, especially in the city of Baltimore, placed
the government in the hands of a decreasing minority also began
to be attacked about this time; but the fear of that minority
which represented the tobacco-raising and slave-holding counties
of south Maryland, with respect to the attitude of the majority
toward slavery prevented any changes until 1837, when the opposition
awakened by the enthusiasm over internal improvements
effected the adoption of amendments which provided for the
election of the governor and senators by a direct vote of the
people, a slight increase in the representation of the city of
Baltimore and the larger counties, and a slight decrease in that
of the smaller counties. Scarcely had these amendments been
carried when the serious financial straits brought on by debt incurred
through the state&rsquo;s promotion of internal improvements
gave rise to the demand for a reduction of governmental expenses
and a limitation of the power of the General Assembly to contract
debts. The result was the new constitution of 1851, which fully
established representation in the counties on the basis of population
and further increased that of Baltimore. The constitution
of 1851 was however chiefly a patchwork of compromises. So,
when during the Civil War Maryland was largely under Federal
control and the demand arose for the abolition of slavery by
the state, another constitutional convention was called, in 1864,
which framed a constitution providing that those who had given
aid to the Rebellion should be disfranchised and that only those
qualified for suffrage in accordance with the new document could
vote on its adoption. This was too revolutionary to stand long
and in 1867 it was superseded by the present constitution. In
national affairs Maryland early took a stand of perhaps far-reaching
consequences in refusing to sign the Articles of Confederation
(which required the assent of all the states before
coming into effect), after all the other states had done so (in 1779),
until those states claiming territory between the Alleghany
Mountains and the Mississippi and north of the Ohio&mdash;Virginia,
New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut&mdash;should have surrendered
such claims. As those states finally yielded, the
Union was strengthened by reason of a greater equality and consequently
less jealousy among the original states, and the United
States came into possession of the first territory in which all the
states had a common interest and out of which new states were
to be created. In the War of 1812 Frederick, Havre de Grace,
and Frenchtown were burned by the British; but particularly
noteworthy were the unsuccessful movements of the enemy by
land and by sea against Baltimore, in which General Robert Ross
(<i>c.</i> 1766-1814), the British commander of the land force, was
killed before anything had been accomplished and the failure
of the fleet to take Fort McHenry after a siege of a day and a
night inspired the song <i>The Star-spangled Banner</i>, composed by
Francis Scott Key who had gone under a flag of truce to secure
from General Ross the release of a friend held as a prisoner by the
British and during the attack was detained on his vessel within
the British lines. In 1861 Maryland as a whole was opposed to
secession but also opposed to coercing the seceded states.
During the war that followed the west section was generally loyal
to the north while the south section favoured the Confederacy
and furnished many soldiers for its army; but most of the state
was kept under Federal control, the writ of habeas corpus being
suspended. The only battle of much importance fought on
Maryland soil during the war was that of Sharpsburg or Antietam
on the 16th and 17th of September 1862. As between political
parties the state has usually been quite equally divided. From
1820 to 1860, however, the Whigs were in general a trifle the
stronger; and from 1866 to 1895 the Democrats were triumphant;
in 1895 a Republican governor was elected; in 1896 Maryland
gave McKinley 32,232 votes more than it gave Bryan; and in
1904 seven Democratic electors and one Republican were chosen;
and in 1908 five Democratic and three Republican.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASACCIO<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (1402-1429), Italian painter. Tommaso Guidi,
son of a notary, Ser Giovanni di Simone Guidi, of the family
of the Scheggia, who had property in Castel S. Giovanni di Val
d&rsquo;Arno, was born in 1402 (according to Milanesi, on the 21st of
December 1401), and acquired the nickname of Masaccio, which
may be translated &ldquo;Lubberly Tom,&rdquo; in consequence of his
slovenly dressing and deportment. From childhood he showed
a great inclination for the arts of design, and he is said to have
studied under his contemporary Masolino da Panicale. In
1421, or perhaps 1423, he was enrolled in the gild of the speziali
(druggists) in Florence, in 1424 in the gild of painters. His
first attempts in painting were made in Florence, and then in
Pisa. Next he went to Rome, still no doubt very young;
although the statement that he returned from Rome to Florence,
in 1420, when only eighteen or nineteen, seems incredible, considering
the works he undertook in the papal city. These included
a series of frescoes still extant in a chapel of the church of
S. Clemente, a Crucifixion, and scenes from the life of St Catherine
and of St Clement, or perhaps some other saint. Though much
inferior to his later productions, these paintings are, for naturalism
and propriety of representation, in advance of their time.
Some critics, however, consider that the design only, if even that,
was furnished by Masaccio, and the execution left to an inferior
hand; this appears highly improbable, as Masaccio, at his early
age, can scarcely have held the position of a master laying out
work for subordinates; indeed Vasari says that Lubberly Tom
was held in small esteem at all times of his brief life. In the
Crucifixion subject the group of the Marys is remarkable; the
picture most generally admired is that of Catherine, in the
presence of Maxentius, arguing against and converting eight
learned doctors. After returning to Florence, Masaccio was
chiefly occupied in painting in the church of the Carmine, and
especially in that &ldquo;Brancacci Chapel&rdquo; which he has rendered
famous almost beyond rivalry in the annals of painting.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chapel, had been built early in the 15th century by Felice
Michele di Piuvichese Brancacci, a noble Florentine. Masaccio&rsquo;s
work in it began probably in 1423, and continued at intervals until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page834" id="page834"></a>834</span>
he finally quitted Florence in 1428. There is a whole library-shelf
of discussion as to what particular things were done by Masaccio
and what by Masolino, and long afterwards by Filippino Lippi, in
the Brancacci Chapel, and also as to certain other paintings by
Masaccio in the Carmine. He began with a trial piece, a majestic
figure of St Paul, not in the chapel; this has perished. A monochrome
of the Procession for the Consecration of the Chapel, regarded
as a wonderful example, for that early period, of perspective and of
grouping, has also disappeared; it contains portraits of Brunelleschi,
Donatello and many others. In the cloister of the Carmine was
discovered in recent years a portion of a fresco by Masaccio representing
a procession; but this, being in colours and not in monochrome,
does not appear to be the Brancacci procession. As regards the
works in the Brancacci chapel itself, the prevalent opinion now is that
Masolino, who used to be credited with a considerable portion of
them, did either nothing, or at most the solitary compartment
which represents St Peter restoring Tabitha to life, and the same
saint healing a cripple. The share which Filippino Lippi bore in the
work admits of little doubt; to him are due various items on which
the fame of Masaccio used principally to be based&mdash;as for instance
the figure of St Paul addressing Peter in prison, which Raphael
partly appropriated; and hence it may be observed that an eloquent
and often-quoted outpouring of Sir Joshua Reynolds in praise of
Masaccio ought in great part to be transferred to Filippino. What
Masaccio really painted in the chapel appears with tolerable certainty
to be as follows, and is ample enough to sustain the high reputation
he has always enjoyed:&mdash;(1) The &ldquo;Temptation of Adam and
Eve&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;Peter and the Tribute-Money&rdquo;; (3) The &ldquo;Expulsion
from Eden&rdquo;; (4) &ldquo;Peter Preaching&rdquo;; (5) &ldquo;Peter Baptizing&rdquo;;
(6) &ldquo;Peter Almsgiving&rdquo;; (7) &ldquo;Peter and John curing the Sick&rdquo;;
(8) &ldquo;Peter restoring to Life the Son of King Theophilus of Antioch&rdquo;
was begun by Masaccio, including the separate incident of &ldquo;Peter
Enthroned,&rdquo; but a large proportion is by Filippino; (9) the double
subject already allotted to Masolino may perhaps be by Masaccio,
and in that case it must have been one of the first in order of execution.
A few words may be given to these pictures individually.
(1) The &ldquo;Temptation&rdquo; shows a degree of appreciation of nude form,
corresponding to the feeling of the antique, such as was at that date
unexampled in painting. (2) The &ldquo;Tribute-Money,&rdquo; a full, harmonious
and expressive composition, contains a head reputed to be the
portrait of Masaccio himself&mdash;one of the apostles, with full locks,
a solid resolute countenance and a pointed beard. (3) The &ldquo;Expulsion&rdquo;
was so much admired by Raphael that, with comparatively
slight modifications, he adopted it as his own in one of the subjects
of the Logge of the Vatican. (5) &ldquo;Peter Baptizing&rdquo; contains some
nude figures of strong naturalistic design; that of the young man,
prepared for the baptismal ceremony, who stands half-shivering
in the raw air, has always been a popular favourite and an object
of artistic study. (8) The restoration of the young man to life has
been open to much discussion as to what precise subject was in view,
but the most probable opinion is that the legend of King Theophilus
was intended.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1427 Masaccio was living in Florence with his mother,
then for the second time a widow, and with his younger brother
Giovanni, a painter of no distinction; he possessed nothing but
debts. In 1428 he was working, as we have seen, in the Brancacci
chapel. Before the end of that year he disappeared from
Florence, going, as it would appear, to Rome, to evade the
importunities of creditors. Immediately afterwards, in 1429,
when his age was twenty-seven or twenty-eight, he was reported
dead. Poisoning by jealous rivals in art was rumoured, but of
this nothing is known. The statement that several years afterwards,
in 1443, he was buried in the Florentine Church of the
Carmine, without any monument, seems to be improbable, and
to depend upon a confused account of the dates, which have now,
after long causing much bewilderment, been satisfactorily cleared
up from extant documents.</p>

<p>It has been said that Masaccio introduced into painting the
plastic boldness of Donatello, and carried out the linear perspective
of Paolo Uccello and Brunelleschi (who had given him
practical instruction), and he was also the first painter who made
some considerable advance in atmospheric perspective. He was
the first to make the architectural framework of his pictures
correspond in a reasonable way to the proportions of the figures.
In the Brancacci chapel he painted with extraordinary swiftness.
The contours of the feet and articulations in his pictures are
imperfect; and his most prominent device for giving roundness
to the figures (a point in which he made a great advance upon
his predecessors) was a somewhat mannered way of putting
the high lights upon the edges. His draperies were broad and
easy, and his landscape details natural, and superior to his age.
In fact, he led the way in representing the objects of nature
correctly, with action, liveliness and relief. Soon after his
death, his work was recognized at its right value, and led to
notable advances; and all the greatest artists of Italy, through
studying the Brancacci chapel, became his champions and
disciples.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of the works attributed to Masaccio in public or private galleries
hardly any are authentic. The one in the Florentine Academy, the
&ldquo;Virgin and Child in the Lap of St Anna,&rdquo; is an exception. The
so-called portrait of Masaccio in the Uffizi Gallery is more probably
Filippino Lippi; and Filippino, or Botticelli, may be the real author
of the head, at first termed a Masaccio, in the National Gallery,
London.</p>

(Florence, 1770-1772). See Layard, <i>The Brancacci Chapel</i>, &amp;c.

<p><span class="bold">MASAI,<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> an Eastern Equatorial African people of Negro-Hamitic
stock, speaking a Nilotic language. The Hamitic
element, which is not great, has probably been derived from
the Galla. The Masai were probably isolated in the high mountains
or plateaus which lie between the Nile and the Karamojo
country. There they originally had their home, and there
to-day the Latuka, who show affinities with them, still live.
Famine or inter-tribal wars drove the Masai in the direction of
Mount Elgon and Lake Rudolf. After a long settlement there
they split into two groups, the Masai proper and the Wa-Kuafi
or agricultural Masai, and this at no very remote date, as the
two tribes speak practically the same language. The more
powerful Masai were purely nomadic and pastoral, their wealth
consisting in enormous herds. The Wa-Kuafi, losing their cattle
to their stronger kinsmen, split up again into the Burkeneji,
the Gwas Ngishu, and the Nyarusi (Enjamusi) and settled as
agriculturists. Meantime the Masai became masters of the
greater part of inner East Africa from Ugogo and the Unyamwezi
countries on the south and west to Mount Kenya and Galla-land
on the north, and eastward to the hundred-mile strip of more
or less settled Bantu country on the coast of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The Masai physical type is slender, but among the finest in
Africa. A tall, well-made people, the men are often well over
six feet, with slim wiry figures, chocolate-coloured, with eyes
often slightly oblique like the Mongolians, but the nose especially
being often almost Caucasian in type, with well formed bridge
and finely cut nostrils. Almost all the men and women knock
out the two lower incisor teeth. For this custom they give the
curious explanation that lockjaw was once very common in
Masai-land, and that it was found to be easy to feed the sufferer
through the gap thus made. All the hair on the body of both
sexes is pulled out with iron tweezers; a Masai with a moustache
or beard is unknown. The hair of the head is shaved in women
and married men; but the hair of a youth at puberty is allowed
to grow till it is long enough to have thin strips of leather plaited
into it. In this way the hair, after a coating of red clay and
mutton fat, is made into pigtails, the largest of which hangs
down the back, another over the forehead, and one on each side.
The warriors smear their whole bodies with the clay and fat,
mixed in equal proportion.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>No tattooing or scarring is performed on the men, but Sir Harry
Johnston noticed women with parallel lines burnt into the skin round
the eyes. In both sexes the lobes of the ears are distended into great
loops, through holes in which large disks of wood are thrust. Bead
necklaces, bead and wood armlets are worn by men, and before
marriage the Masai girl has thick iron wire wound round her legs
so tightly as to check the calf development. The women wear
dressed hides or calico; the old men wear a skin or cloth cape. The
warriors wind red calico round their waists, a circle of ostrich feathers
round their face (or a cap of lion or colobus skin) and fringes of long
white fur round the knee. Masai houses are of two kinds. The
agricultural tribes build round huts with walls of reeds or sticks,
and conical, grass-thatched roofs. The true Masai nomads, however,
have houses unlike those of any other neighbouring negro tribe.
Long, low (not more than 6 ft. high), flat-roofed, they are built on a
framework of sticks with strong partitions dividing the structure
into separate compartments, each a dwelling, with low, oblong door.
Mud and cow-dung are plastered on to the brushwood used in the
roofing. Beds are made of brushwood neatly stacked and covered
with hides. The fireplace is a circle of stones. The only furniture,
besides cooking-pots, consists of long gourds used as milkcans, half-gourds
as cups, and small three-legged stools cut out of a single block
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page835" id="page835"></a>835</span>
of wood and used by the elder men to sit on. The Masai are not
hunters of big game except lions, but they eat the eland and kudu.
The domestic animals are cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys and dogs.
Only women and the married men smoke. The dead are ordinarily
not buried, but the bodies are carried a short distance from the
village and left on the ground to be devoured by hyenas, jackals and
vultures. Important chiefs are buried, however, and a year later
the eldest son or successor recovers the skull, which is treasured as
a charm. The medicine men of Masai are often the chiefs, and
the supreme chief is almost always a medicine man.</p>

<p>The Masai believe in a nature-god as a supreme being&mdash;Ngai
(&ldquo;sky&rdquo;)&mdash;and his aid is invoked in cases of drought by a ceremonial
chant of the children, standing in a circle after sunset, each with a
bunch of grass in its hand. They have creation-myths involving
four gods, the black, white, grey and red deities. They believe
there is no future for women or common people, but that such
distinction is reserved for chiefs. Pythons and a species of snake
are revered as the reincarnated forms of their more celebrated
ancestors. A kind of worship is paid to the hyena in some districts:
the whole tribe going into mourning if the beast crosses their
path. The Masai also have a vague tree-worship, and grass is a
sacred symbol. When making peace a tuft is held in the right hand,
and when the warriors start out on a raid their sweethearts throw
grass after them or lay it in the forks of trees. But the oddest of
their superstitious customs is the importance attached to spitting.
To spit upon a person or thing is regarded as a sign of reverence
and goodwill, as among other Nilotic tribes. Newly born children
are spat on by every one who sees them. Johnston states that every
Masai before extending his hand to him spat on it first. They spit
when they meet and when they part, and bargains are sealed in this
way. Joseph Thomson writes, &ldquo;being regarded as a wizard of the
first water, the Masai flocked to me ... and the more copiously
I spat on them the greater was their delight.&rdquo; The Masai has no
love for work, and practises no industries. The women attend to
his personal needs; and trades such as smelting and forging are left
to enslaved tribes such as the Dorobo (Wandorobo). These manufacture
spears with long blades and butts and the peculiar swords
or <i>simés</i> like long slender leaves, very narrow towards the hilt and
broad at the point. Most of the Masai live in the British East
Africa Protectorate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASANIELLO,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> an abbreviation of <span class="sc">Tommaso Aniello</span> (1622-1647),
an Amalfi fisherman, who became leader of the revolt
against Spanish rule in Naples in 1647. Misgovernment and
fiscal oppression having aroused much discontent throughout
the two Sicilies, a revolt broke out at Palermo in May 1647, and
the people of Naples followed the example of the Sicilians. The
immediate occasion of the latter rising was a new tax on fruit,
the ordinary food of the poor, and the chief instigator of the
movement was Masaniello, who took command of the malcontents.
The outbreak began on the 7th of July 1647 with a riot
at the city gates between the fruit-vendors of the environs and
the customs officers; the latter were forced to flee, and the
customs office was burnt. The rioters then poured into Naples
and forced their way into the palace of the viceroy, the hated
Count d&rsquo;Arcos, who had to take refuge first in a neighbouring
convent, then in Castel Sant&rsquo; Elmo, and finally in Castelnuovo.
Masaniello attempted to discipline the mob and restrain its
vandalic instincts, and to some extent he succeeded; attired in his
fisherman&rsquo;s garb, he gave audiences and administered justice
from a wooden scaffolding outside his house. Several rioters,
including the duke of Maddaloni, an opponent of the viceroy,
and his brother Giuseppe Caraffa, who had come to Naples to
make trouble, were condemned to death by him and executed.
The mob, which every day obtained more arms and was becoming
more intractable, terrorized the city, drove off the troops
summoned from outside, and elected Masaniello &ldquo;captain-general&rdquo;;
the revolt was even spreading to the provinces.
Finally, the viceroy, whose negotiations with Masaniello had
been frequently interrupted by fresh tumults, ended by granting
all the concessions demanded of him. On the 13th of July,
through the mediation of Cardinal Filomarino, archbishop of
Naples, a convention was signed between D&rsquo;Arcos and Masaniello
as &ldquo;leader of the most faithful people of Naples,&rdquo; by which the
rebels were pardoned, the more oppressive taxes removed, and
the citizens granted certain rights, including that of remaining
in arms until the treaty should have been ratified by the king
of Spain. The astute D&rsquo;Arcos then invited Masaniello to the
palace, confirmed his title of &ldquo;captain-general of the Neapolitan
people,&rdquo; gave him a gold chain of office, and offered him a
pension. Masaniello refused the pension and laid down his
dignities, saying that he wished to return to his old life as a
fisherman; but he was entertained by the viceroy and, partly
owing to the strain and excitement of the past days, partly
because he was made dizzy by his astonishing change of fortune,
or perhaps, as it was believed, because he was poisoned, he lost
his head and behaved like a frenzied maniac. The people
continued to obey him for some days, until, abandoned by his
best friends, who went over to the Spanish party, he was murdered
while haranguing a mob on the market-place on the 16th of July
1647; his head was cut off and brought by a band of roughs to
the viceroy and the body buried outside the city. But the next
day the populace, angered by the alteration of the measures
for weighing bread, repented of its insane fury; the body of
Masaniello was dug up and given a splendid funeral, at which the
viceroy himself was represented.</p>

<p>Masaniello&rsquo;s insurrection appealed to the imagination of poets
and composers, and formed the subject of several operas, of which
the most famous is Auber&rsquo;s La Muelle de Portici (1828).</p>

attracted attention, so that money was provided by a wealthy
amateur for him to study at the Milan Conservatoire. But
Mascagni chafed at the teaching, and soon left Milan to become
conductor to a touring operatic company. After a somewhat
chequered period he suddenly leapt into fame by the production
at Rome in 1890 of his one-act opera <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>,
containing a tuneful &ldquo;intermezzo,&rdquo; which became wildly popular.
Mascagni was the musical hero of the hour, and <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i> was performed everywhere. But his later work
failed to repeat this success. <i>L&rsquo;Amico Fritz</i> (1891), <i>I Rantzau</i>
(1892), <i>Guglielmo Ratcliff</i> (1895), <i>Silvano</i> (1895), <i>Zanetto</i> (1896),
<i>Iris</i> (1898), <i>Le Maschere</i> (1901), and <i>Amica</i> (1905), were coldly
or adversely received; and though <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>, with its
catchy melodies, still held the stage, this succession of failures
involved a steady decline in the composer&rsquo;s reputation. From
1895 to 1903 Mascagni was director of the Pesaro Conservatoire,
but in the latter year, having left his post in order to tour through
the United States, he was dismissed from the appointment.</p>

the sea, on the southern slope of a range forming part of the
Little Atlas Mountains, and occupies two small hills separated
by the Wad Tudman, which is crossed by three stone bridges.

few vestiges of the Moorish period remaining. Among the
public buildings are two mosques, in one of which Abd-el-Kader
preached the <i>jihad</i>. The town also contains the usual establishments
attaching to the seat of a sub-prefect and the centre of a
military subdivision. The principal industry is the making of
wine, the white wines of Mascara being held in high repute.
There is also a considerable trade in grains and oil. A branch

<p>Mascara (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;mother of soldiers&rdquo;) was the capital of a Turkish
beylik during the Spanish occupation of Oran from the 16th to the
close of the 18th century; but for the most of that period it occupied
a site about two miles distant from the present position. On the
removal of the bey to Oran its importance rapidly declined; and
it was an insignificant place when in 1832 Abd-el-Kader, who was
born in the neighbourhood, chose it as the seat of his power. It
was laid in ruins by the French under Marshal Clausel and the duke
of Orleans in 1835, the amir retreating south. Being reoccupied
by Abd-el-Kader in 1838, Mascara was again captured in 1841 by
Marshal Bugeaud and General Lamoricière.</p>

son of a barrister at Aix. Born at Marseilles in 1634, he early
entered the French Oratory, and obtained great reputation as a
preacher. Paris confirmed the judgment of the provinces; in
1666 he was asked to preach before the court, and became a
great favourite with Louis XIV., who said that his eloquence
was one of the few things that never grew old. In 1671 he was
appointed bishop of Tulle; eight years later he was transferred
to the larger diocese of Agen. He still continued, however, to
preach regularly at court, being especially in request for funeral
orations. A panegyric on Turenne, delivered in 1675, is considered
his masterpiece. His style is strongly tinged with
<i>préciosité</i>; and his chief surviving interest is as a glaring example
of the evils from which Bossuet delivered the French pulpit.

duties at Agen, where he died in 1703.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASHAM, ABIGAIL,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> <span class="sc">Lady</span> (d. 1734), favourite of Anne,
queen of England, was the daughter of Francis Hill, a London
merchant, her mother being an aunt of Sarah Jennings, duchess
of Marlborough. The family being reduced to poor circumstances
through Hill&rsquo;s speculations, Lady Churchill (as she then was),
lady of the bedchamber to the Princess Anne, befriended her
cousin Abigail, whom she took into her own household at
St Albans, and for whom after the accession of the princess to
the throne she procured an appointment in the queen&rsquo;s household
about the year 1704. It was not long before Abigail Hill began
to supplant her powerful and imperious kinswoman in the
favour of Queen Anne. Whether she was guilty of the deliberate
ingratitude charged against her by the duchess of Marlborough
is uncertain. It is not unlikely that, in the first instance at all
events, Abigail&rsquo;s influence over the queen was not so much due
to subtle scheming on her part as to the pleasing contrast
between her gentle and genial character and the dictatorial
temper of the duchess, which after many years of undisputed
sway had at last become intolerable to Anne. The first intimation
of her protégé&rsquo;s growing favour with the queen came to the
duchess in the summer of 1707, when she learned that Abigail
Hill had been privately married to a gentleman of the queen&rsquo;s
household named Samuel Masham, and that the queen herself
had been present at the marriage. Inquiry then elicited the
information that Abigail had for some time enjoyed considerable
intimacy with her royal mistress, no hint of which had previously
reached the duchess. Abigail was said to be a cousin of Robert
Harley, earl of Oxford, and after the latter&rsquo;s dismissal from office
in February 1708 she assisted him in maintaining confidential
relations with the queen. The completeness of her ascendancy
was seen in 1710 when the queen compelled Marlborough, much
against his will, to give an important command to Colonel John
Hill, Abigail&rsquo;s brother; and when Sunderland, Godolphin, and
the other Whig ministers were dismissed from office, largely
owing to her influence, to make way for Oxford and Bolingbroke.
In the following year the duchess of Marlborough was also dismissed
from her appointment at court, Mrs Masham taking her
place as keeper of the privy purse. In 1711 the ministers, intent on
bringing about the disgrace of Marlborough and arranging the
Peace of Utrecht, found it necessary to secure their position in the
House of Lords by creating twelve new peers; one of these was
Samuel Masham, the favourite&rsquo;s husband, though Anne showed
some reluctance to raise her bedchamber woman to a position
in which she might show herself less ready to give her personal
services to the queen. Lady Masham soon quarrelled with
Oxford, and set herself to foster by all the means in her power the
queen&rsquo;s growing personal distaste for her minister. Oxford&rsquo;s
vacillation between the Jacobites and the adherents of the
Hanoverian succession to the Crown probably strengthened the
opposition of Lady Masham, who now warmly favoured the
Jacobite party led by Bolingbroke and Atterbury. Altercations
took place in the queen&rsquo;s presence between Lady Masham and
the minister; and finally, on the 27th of July 1714, Anne dismissed
Oxford from his office of lord high treasurer, and three
days later gave the staff to the duke of Shrewsbury. Anne died
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page837" id="page837"></a>837</span>
on the 1st of August, and Lady Masham then retired into private
life. She died on the 6th of December 1734.</p>

<p>Lady Masham was by no means the vulgar, ill-educated person
she was represented to have been by her defeated rival, the
duchess of Marlborough; her extant letters, showing not a little
refinement of literary style, prove the reverse. Swift, with
whom both she and her husband were intimate, describes Lady
Masham as &ldquo;a person of a plain sound understanding, of great
truth and sincerity, without the least mixture of falsehood or
disguise.&rdquo; The barony of Masham became extinct when Lady
Masham&rsquo;s son, Samuel, the 2nd baron, died in June 1776.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASHAM, SAMUEL CUNLIFFE LISTER,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1815-1906),
English inventor, born at Calverley Hall, near Bradford,
on the 1st of January 1815, was the fourth son of Ellis Cunliffe
(1774-1853), who successively took the names of Lister and
Lister-Kay, and was the first member of parliament elected
for Bradford after the Reform Act of 1832. It was at first
proposed that he should take orders, but he preferred a business
career and became a clerk at Liverpool. In 1838 he and his
elder brother John started as worsted spinners and manufacturers
in a new mill which their father built for them at
Manningham, and about five years later he turned his attention
to the problem of mechanical wool-combing, which, in
spite of the efforts of E. Cartwright and numerous other
inventors, still awaited a satisfactory solution. Two years
of hard work spent in modifying and improving existing
devices enabled him to produce a machine which worked
well, and subsequently he consolidated his position by
buying up rival patents, as well as by taking out additional
ones of his own. His combing machines came into such
demand that though they were made for only £200 apiece he
was able to sell them for £1200, and the saving they effected
in the cost of production not only brought about a reduction
in the price of clothing, but in consequence of the increase in
the sales created the necessity for new supplies of wool, and
thus contributed to the development of Australian sheep-farming.
In 1855 he was sent a sample of silk waste (the refuse left in
reeling silk from the cocoons) and asked whether he could find
a way of utilizing the fibre it contained. The task occupied
his time for many years and brought him to the verge of bankruptcy,
but at last he succeeded in perfecting silk-combing
appliances which enabled him to make yarn that in one year
sold for 23s. a pound, though produced from raw material
costing only 6d. or 1s. a pound. Another important and lucrative
invention in connexion with silk manufacture was his velvet
loom for piled fabrics; and this, with the silk comb worked at
his Manningham mill, yielded him an annual income of £200,000
for many years. But the business was seriously affected by the
prohibitory duties imposed by America, and this was one reason
why he was an early and determined critic of the British policy
of free imports. In 1891 he was made a peer; he took his title
from the little Yorkshire town of Masham, close to which is
Swinton Park, purchased by him in 1888. In 1886 an Albert
medal was awarded him for his inventions, which were mostly
related to the textile industries, though he occasionally diverged
to other subjects, such as an air-brake for railways. He was
fond of outdoor sports, especially coursing and shooting, and
was a keen patron of the fine arts. He died at Swinton
Park on the 2nd of February 1906, and was succeeded in the
title by his son.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASHONA<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span>, a Bantu-negro people, inhabitants of Mashonaland,
Southern Rhodesia. The name Mashona has been derived
from the contemptuous term <i>Amashuina</i> applied by the Matabele
to the aborigines owing to the habit of the latter of taking
refuge in the rocky hills with which the country abounds. Before
the Matabele invasion about 1840 most of Southern Rhodesia
was occupied by the Makalanga, the Makorikori and the Banyai,
all closely related. Most of them became subject to the Matabele,
but although they suffered severely from their attacks, the
Mashona preserved a certain national unity. In 1890 the
Mashona came under British protection (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rhodesia</a></span>). They
are in general a peaceful, mild-mannered people, industrious
and successful farmers, skilful potters, and weavers of bark
cloth.</p>

<p>The crafts, however, in which they excel are the smelting
and forging of iron and wood-carving. They are also great
hunters; and they are very fond of music, the most usual instrument
being the &ldquo;piano&rdquo; with iron keys. Bows and arrows,
assegais and axes are the native weapons, but all who can get
them now use guns. Up to their conquest by the Matabele the
Mashona worked the gold diggings which are scattered over
their country; indeed as late as 1870 certain Mashona were still
extracting gold from quartz (<i>Geog. Jour.</i> April 1906).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASK<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (Fr. <i>masque</i>, apparently from med. Lat. <i>mascus, masca</i>,
spectre, through Ital. <i>maschera</i>, Span. <i>mascara</i>), a covering
for the face, taking various forms, used either as a protective
screen or as a disguise. In the latter sense masks are mostly
associated with the artificial faces worn by actors in dramatic
representations, or assumed for exciting terror (<i>e.g.</i> in savage
rites). The spelling &ldquo;masque,&rdquo; representing the same word,
is now in English used more specially for certain varieties of
drama in which masks were originally worn (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Drama</a></span>); so
also &ldquo;masquerade,&rdquo; particularly in the sense of a masked ball
or an entertainment where the personages arc disguised. Both
&ldquo;mask&rdquo; and &ldquo;masquerade&rdquo; have naturally passed into
figurative and technical meanings, the former especially for
various senses of face and head (head of a fox, grotesque faces
in sculpture), or as equivalent to &ldquo;cloak&rdquo; or &ldquo;screen&rdquo; (as in
fortification or other military uses, fencing, &amp;c.). And in the
case of &ldquo;death-masks&rdquo; the term is employed for the portrait-casts,
generally of plaster or metallic foil, taken from the face
of a dead person (also similarly from the living), an ancient
practice of considerable interest in art. An interesting collection
made by Laurence Hutton (see his <i>Portraits in Plaster</i>, 1894),
is at Princeton University in the United States. (For the
historical mystery of the &ldquo;man in the iron mask,&rdquo; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iron
Mask</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The ancient Greek and Roman masks worn by their actors&mdash;hollow
figures of heads&mdash;had the double object of identifying
the performers with the characters assumed, and of increasing
the power of the voice by means of metallic mouthpieces. They
were derived like the drama from the rural religious festivities,
the wearing of mock faces or beards being a primitive custom,
connected no doubt with many early types of folk-lore and
religion. The use of the dramatic mask was evolved in the
later theatre through the mimes and the Italian popular comedy
into pantomime; and the masquerade similarly came from
Italy, where the <i>domino</i> was introduced from Venice. The
<i>domino</i> (originally apparently an ecclesiastical garment) was
a loose cloak with a small half-mask worn at masquerades and
costume-balls by persons not otherwise dressed in character;
and the word is applied also to the person wearing it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASKELYNE, NEVIL<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1732-1811), English astronomer-royal,
was born in London on the 6th of October 1732. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page838" id="page838"></a>838</span>
solar eclipse of 1748 made a deep impression upon him; and
having graduated as seventh wrangler from Trinity College,
Cambridge, in 1754, he determined to devote himself wholly
to astronomy. He became intimate with James Bradley in
1755, and in 1761 was deputed by the Royal Society to make
observations of the transit of Venus at St Helena. During
the voyage he experimented upon the determination of longitude
by lunar distances, and ultimately effected the introduction
of the method into navigation (<i>q.v.</i>). In 1765 he succeeded
Nathaniel Bliss as astronomer-royal. Having energetically
discharged the duties of his office during forty-six years, he
died on the 9th of February 1811.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Maskelyne&rsquo;s first contribution to astronomical literature was
&ldquo;A Proposal for Discovering the Annual Parallax of Sirius,&rdquo; published
in 1760 (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> li. 889). Subsequent volumes of the
same series contained his observations of the transits of Venus
(1761 and 1769), on the tides at St Helena (1762), and on various
astronomical phenomena at St Helena (1764) and at Barbados
(1764). In 1763 he published the <i>British Mariner&rsquo;s Guide</i>, which
includes the suggestion that in order to facilitate the finding of
longitude at sea lunar distances should be calculated beforehand
for each year and published in a form accessible to navigators.
This important proposal, the germ of the <i>Nautical Almanac</i>, was
approved of by the government, and under the care of Maskelyne
the <i>Nautical Almanac</i> for 1767 was published in 1766. He continued
during the remainder of his life the superintendence of this invaluable
annual. He further induced the government to print his observations
annually, thereby securing the prompt dissemination of a large
mass of data inestimable from their continuity and accuracy.
Maskelyne had but one assistant, yet the work of the observatory
was perfectly organized and methodically executed. He
introduced several practical improvements, such as the measurement
of time to tenths of a second; and he prevailed upon the
government to replace Bird&rsquo;s mural quadrant by a repeating
circle 6 ft. in diameter. The new instrument was constructed
by E. Troughton; but Maskelyne did not live to see it completed.
In 1772 he suggested to the Royal Society the famous Schehallion
experiment for the determination of the earth&rsquo;s density and carried
out his plan in 1774 (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1. 495), the apparent difference
of latitude between two stations on opposite sides of the mountain
being compared with the real difference of latitude obtained by
triangulation. From Maskelyne&rsquo;s observations Charles Hutton
deduced a density for the earth 4.5 times that of water (ib. lxviii.
782). Maskelyne also took a great interest in various geodetical
operations, notably the measurement of the length of a degree of
latitude in Maryland and Pennsylvania (ibid. lviii. 323), executed
by Mason and Dixon in 1766-1768, and later the determination of
the relative longitude of Greenwich and Paris (ib. lxxvii. 151). On
the French side the work was conducted by Count Cassini, Legendre,
and Méchain; on the English side by General Roy. This triangulation
was the beginning of the great trigonometrical survey which
has since been extended all over the country. His observations
appeared in four large folio volumes (1776-1811). Some of them
were reprinted in S. Vince&rsquo;s <i>Astronomy</i> (vol. iii.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASOLINO DA PANICALE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1383-<i>c.</i> 1445), Florentine painter,
was said to have been born at Panicale di Valdelsa, near Florence.
It is more probable, however, that he was born in Florence
itself, his father, Cristoforo Fini, who was an &ldquo;imbiancatore,&rdquo;
or whitewasher, having been domiciled in the Florentine quarter
of S. Croce. There is reason to believe that Tommaso, nicknamed
Masolino, was a pupil of the painter Starnina, and
was principally influenced in style by Antonio Veneziano; he
may probably enough have become in the sequel the master
of Masaccio. He was born in 1383; he died later than 1429,
perhaps as late as 1440 or even 1447. Towards 1423 he entered
the service of Filippo Scolari, the Florentine-born <i>obergespann</i>
of Temeswar in Hungary, and stayed some time in
that country, returning towards 1427 to Italy. The only works
which can with certainty be assigned to him are a series of
wall paintings executed towards 1428, commissioned by Cardinal
Branda Castiglione, in the church of Castiglione d&rsquo;Olona,
not far from Milan, and another series in the adjoining baptistery.
The first set is signed as painted by &ldquo;Masolinus de
Florentia.&rdquo; It was recovered in 1843 from a coating of whitewash,
considerably damaged; its subject matter is taken
from the lives of the Virgin and of SS Lawrence and Stephen.
The series in the baptistery relates to the life and death of
John the Baptist. The reputation of Masolino had previously
rested almost entirely upon the considerable share which he
was supposed to have had in the celebrated frescoes of the
Brancacci Chapel, in the Church of the Carmine in Florence;
he was regarded as the precursor of Masaccio, and by many
years the predecessor of Filippino Lippi, in the execution of
a large proportion of these works. But from a comparison
of the Castiglione with the Brancacci frescoes, and from other
data, it is very doubtful whether Masolino had any hand at
all in the latter series. Possibly he painted in the Brancacci
Chapel certain specified subjects which are now either destroyed
or worked over. Several paintings assigned to Masolino on the
authority of Vasari are now ascribed to Masaccio.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON, FRANCIS<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (1799-1874), American missionary, was
born in York, England, on the 2nd of April 1799. His grandfather,
Francis Mason, was the founder of the Baptist Society
in York, and his father, a shoemaker by trade, was a Baptist
lay preacher there. After working with his father as a shoemaker
for several years, he emigrated in 1818 to the United States, and
in Massachusetts was licensed to preach as a Baptist in 1827.
In 1830 he was sent by the American Baptist Missionary
Convention to labour among the Karens in Burma. Besides
conducting a training college for native preachers and teachers
at Tavoy, he translated the Bible into the two principal dialects
of the Karens, the Sgaw and the Pwo (his translation being published
in 1853), and Matthew, Genesis, and the Psalms into the
Bghai dialect. He also published <i>A Pali Grammar on the Basis of
Kachchayano, with Chrestomathy and Vocabulary</i> (1868). In
1852 he published a book of great value on the fauna and flora
of British Burma, of which an improved edition appeared in
1860 under the title <i>Burmah, its People and Natural Productions</i>,
and a third edition (2 vols.) revised and enlarged by W. Theobald
in 1882-1883. He died at Rangoon on the 3rd of March 1874.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON, GEORGE<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1725-1792), American statesman, was
born in Stafford county (the part which is now Fairfax county),
Virginia, in 1725. His family was of Royalist descent and
emigrated to America after the execution of Charles I. His
colonial ancestors held official positions in the civil and military
service of Virginia. Mason was a near neighbour and a lifelong
friend of George Washington, though in later years they
disagreed in politics. His large estates and high social standing,
together with his personal ability, gave Mason great influence
among the Virginia planters, and he became identified with
many enterprises, such as the organization of the Ohio Company
and the founding of Alexandria (1749). He was a member of
the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1759-1760. In 1769 he drew
up for Washington a series of non-importation resolutions,
which were adopted by the Virginia legislature. In July 1774
he wrote for a convention in Fairfax county a series of resolutions
known as the Fairfax Resolves, in which he advocated a congress
of the colonies and suggested non-intercourse with Great Britain,
a policy subsequently adopted by Virginia and later by the
Continental Congress. He was a member of the Virginia
Committee of Safety from August to December 1775, and of
the Virginia Convention in 1775 and 1776; and in 1776 he drew
up the Virginia Constitution and the famous Bill of Rights,
a radically democratic document which had great influence on
American political institutions. In 1780 he outlined the plan
which was subsequently adopted by Virginia for ceding to
the Federal government her claim to the &ldquo;back lands,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> to
territory north and north-west of the Ohio river. From 1776
to 1788 he represented Fairfax county in the Virginia Assembly.
He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1776-1780
and again in 1787-1788, and in 1787 was a member of the convention
that framed the Federal Constitution, and as one of its
ablest debaters took an active part in the work. Particularly
notable was his opposition to the compromises in regard to
slavery and the slave-trade. Indeed, like most of the prominent
Virginians of the time, Mason was strongly in favour of the
gradual abolition of slavery. He objected to the large and
indefinite powers given by the completed Constitution to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page839" id="page839"></a>839</span>
Congress, so he joined with Patrick Henry in opposing its ratification
in the Virginia Convention (1788). Failing in this he
suggested amendments, the substance of several of which was
afterwards embodied in the present Bill of Rights. Declining
an appointment as a United States Senator from Virginia, he
retired to his home, Gunston Hall (built by him about 1758
and named after the family home in Staffordshire, England),
where he died on the 7th of October 1792. With James Madison
and Thomas Jefferson, Mason carried through the Virginia
legislature measures disestablishing the Episcopal Church
and protecting all forms of worship. In politics he was a
radical republican, who believed that local government should
be kept strong and central government weak; his democratic
theories had much influence in Virginia and other southern
and western states.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON, GEORGE HEMMING<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1818-1872), English painter,
was born at Wetley Abbey, the eldest son of a Staffordshire
county gentleman. He was educated at King Edward&rsquo;s School,
Birmingham, and studied for the medical profession for five
years under Dr Watt of that city. But all his thoughts being
given to art, he abandoned medicine in 1844 and travelled
for a time on the Continent, finally settling in Rome, where he
remained for some years and sought to make a living as an
artist. During this period he underwent many privations
which permanently affected his health; but he continued to
labour assiduously, making studies of the picturesque scenery
that surrounded him, and with hardly any instruction except
that received from Nature and from the Italian pictures he
gradually acquired the painter&rsquo;s skill. At least two important
works are referable to this period: &ldquo;Ploughing in the Campagna,&rdquo;
shown in the Royal Academy of 1857, and &ldquo;In the Salt
Marshes, Campagna,&rdquo; exhibited in the following year. After
Mason&rsquo;s return from the continent, in 1858, when he settled at
Wetley Abbey, he continued for a while to paint Italian subjects
from studies made during his stay abroad, and then his art
began to touch in a wonderfully tender and poetic way the
peasant life of England, especially of his native Staffordshire,
and the homely landscape in the midst of which that life was
set. The first picture of this class was &ldquo;Wind on the Wold,&rdquo;
and it was followed&mdash;along with much else of admirable quality&mdash;by
the painter&rsquo;s three greatest works: The &ldquo;Evening Hymn&rdquo;
(1868), a band of Staffordshire mill-girls returning from their
work; &ldquo;Girls dancing by the Sea&rdquo; (1869); and the &ldquo;Harvest
Moon&rdquo; (1872). He left Staffordshire in 1865 and went to
live at Hammersmith; and he was elected an associate of the
Royal Academy in 1869. By that time he had fully established
his position as an artist of unusual power and individuality.
Mason died on the 22nd of October 1872. In his work he laboured
under the double disadvantage of feeble and uncertain health,
and a want of thorough art-training, so that his pictures were
never produced easily, or without strenuous and long-continued
effort. His art is great in virtue of the solemn pathos which
pervades it, of the dignity and beauty in rustic life which
it reveals, of its keen perception of noble form and graceful
motion, and of rich effects of colour and subdued light. In
<i>motif</i> and treatment it has something in common with the art
of Millet and Jules Breton, as with that of Frederick Walker
among Englishmen; though he had neither the occasional
uncouth robustness of Millet nor the firm actuality of Jules
Breton. His pictures &ldquo;Wind on the Wold&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Cast
Shoe&rdquo; are in the National Gallery of British Art.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON, JAMES MURRAY<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (1798-1871), American political
leader, was born in Fairfax county, Virginia, on the 3rd of
November 1798, the grandson of George Mason (1723-1792).
Educated at the university of Pennsylvania and the college
of William and Mary, he was admitted to the bar in 1820. He
was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1826-1827
and 1828-1831, of the state Constitutional Convention of 1829,
of the National House of Representatives (1837-1839), of the
United States Senate from 1847 until July 1861 (when, with
other Southern senators he was formally expelled&mdash;he had
previously withdrawn), and of the Virginia Secession Convention
in April 1861. Entering politics as a Jacksonian Democrat,
Mason was throughout his career a consistent strict constructionist,
opposing protective tariffs, internal improvements by
the national government, and all attempts to restrict or control
the spread of slavery, which he sincerely believed to be essential
to the social and political welfare of the South. He was the
author of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and in 1860 was
chairman of the Senate committee which investigated the John
Brown raid. After Lincoln&rsquo;s election as President he was one
of the strongest advocates of secession in Virginia. He was
appointed in August 1861 commissioner of the Confederate
States to Great Britain. The British ship &ldquo;Trent,&rdquo; upon
which he and John Slidell, the commissioner to France, sailed,
was intercepted (Nov. 8, 1861) by a United States ship-of-war
(the &ldquo;San Jacinto,&rdquo; Captain Charles Wilkes), and the two
commissioners were seized and carried as prisoners to Boston.
Great Britain immediately demanded their release, and war
for a time seemed imminent; but owing mainly to the tactful
diplomacy of the prince consort, Lincoln acknowledged that
the seizure of Mason and Slidell was a violation of the rights
of Great Britain as a neutral, and on the 1st of January 1862
released the commissioners. The incident has become known
in history as the &ldquo;Trent Affair.&rdquo; Mason at once proceeded
to London, where, however, he was unable to secure official
recognition, and his commission to Great Britain was withdrawn
late in 1863. He remained in Europe, spending most of his
time at Paris and holding blank commissions which he was
authorized to fill in at his discretion in case the presence of a
Confederate commissioner should seem desirable at any particular
European court. These commissions, however, he did
not use. After the war he lived for several years in Canada,
but returned in 1869 to Virginia, and on the 28th of April 1871
died at Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON, SIR JOHN<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (1503-1566), English diplomatist, was
born of humble parentage at Abingdon in 1503, and was educated
at Oxford, where he became Fellow of All Souls in 1521. He
was ordained before 1531. Most of his early years were spent
on the Continent, where he witnessed the meeting between
Henry VIII. and Francis I. at Calais in 1532, and where he
was employed in collecting information for the English government,
gaining in this work the reputation of a capable diplomatist.
By his never-failing caution, moderation and pliancy,
Mason succeeded in keeping himself in favour with four successive
sovereigns of the Tudor monarchy. In 1537 he became secretary
to the English ambassador at Madrid, Sir Thomas Wyat; but
when the latter was put on his trial for treason in 1541 Mason
was unmolested, and soon afterwards was appointed clerk of
the privy council, and procured for himself sundry other posts
and privileges. Mason was knighted and made dean of Winchester
by Edward VI. He was one of the commissioners to
negotiate the treaty by which Boulogne was restored to France
in 1550, and in the same year he became English ambassador
in Paris, where he helped to arrange the bethrothal of Edward VI.
to the princess Elizabeth of France. He returned to England
at the end of 1551, became clerk of parliament, received extensive
grants of land, and in 1552 was made chancellor of Oxford
University. He was elected member of parliament in the
same year. On the death of Edward VI., he at first joined
the party of Northumberland and the Lady Jane Grey; but
quickly perceiving his mistake he took an active part in procuring
the proclamation of Mary as queen. Mason now received fresh
tokens of royal favour, being confirmed in all his secular,
though not in his ecclesiastical, offices; and in 1553 he was
appointed English ambassador at the court of the emperor
Charles V., of whose abdication at Brussels in October 1555
he wrote a vivid account. He took a prominent share in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page840" id="page840"></a>840</span>
administrative business of the government in the first years
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and largely influenced her foreign policy
until his death, which occurred on the 20th of April 1566. Sir
John Mason married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Isley
of Sundridge, Kent, and widow of Richard Hill. He had no
children, and his heir was Anthony Wyckes, whom he had
adopted, and who assumed the name of Mason and left a large
family.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON, JOHN<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (1586-1635), founder of New Hampshire,
U.S.A., was born in King&rsquo;s Lynn, Norfolk, England. In 1610
he commanded a small naval force sent by James I. to assist
in subduing the Hebrides Islands. From 1615 to 1621 he was
governor of the English colony on the north side of Conception
Bay in Newfoundland; he explored the island, made the first
English map of it (published in 1625), and wrote a descriptive
tract entitled <i>A Briefe Discourse of the Newfoundland</i> (Edinburgh,
1620) to promote the colonization of the island by Scotsmen.
Here he was brought into official relations with Sir
Ferdinando Gorges, then a commissioner to regulate the Newfoundland
fisheries. In March 1622 Mason obtained from
the Council for New England, of which Gorges was the most
influential member, a grant of the territory (which he named
Mariana) between the Naumkeag or Salem river and the
Merrimac, and in the following August he and Gorges together
received a grant of the region between the Merrimac and
Kennebec rivers, and extending 60 m. inland. From 1625 to
1629 Mason was engaged as treasurer and paymaster of the
English army in the wars which England was waging against
Spain and France. Towards the close of 1629 Mason and
Gorges agreed upon a division of the territory held jointly
by them, and on the 7th of November 1629 Mason received
from the Council a separate grant of the tract between the
Merrimac and the Piscataqua, which he now named New
Hampshire. Thinking that the Piscataqua river had its source
in Lake Champlain, Mason with Gorges and a few other associates
secured, on the 17th of November 1629, a grant of a
region which was named Laconia (apparently from the number
of lakes it was supposed to contain), and was described as
bordering on Lake Champlain, extending 10 m. east and
south from it and far to the west and north-west, together
with 1000 acres to be located along some convenient harbour,
presumably near the mouth of the Piscataqua. In November
1631 Mason and his associates obtained, under the name of
the Pescataway Grant, a tract on both sides of the Piscataqua
river, extending 30 m. inland and including also the Isles
of Shoals. Mason became a member of the Council for New
England in June 1632, and its vice-president in the following
November; and in 1635, when the members decided to
divide their territory among themselves and surrender their
charter, he was allotted as his share all the region between the
Naumkeag and Piscataqua rivers extending 60 m. inland,
the southern half of the Isles of Shoals, and a ten-thousand acre
tract, called Masonia, on the west side of the Kennebec river.
In October 1635 he was appointed vice-admiral of New England,
but he died early in December, before crossing the Atlantic.
He was buried in Westminster Abbey. Forty-four years
after his death New Hampshire was made a royal province.</p>

leader and diplomatist, was born in Greenesville county,
Virginia, on the 18th of April 1799. Graduating at the university
of North Carolina in 1816, he studied law in the famous
Litchfield (Connecticut) law school, and in 1819 was admitted
to practice in Southampton county, Virginia. He served in the
Virginia house of delegates in 1823-1827, in the state constitutional
convention of 1829-1830, and from 1831 to 1837 in
the National House of Representatives, being chairman of the

attorney-general (1845-1846) and secretary of the navy (1846-1849),
succeeding George Bancroft, under President Polk. He
was president of the Virginia constitutional convention of 1851,
and from 1853 until his death at Paris on the 3rd of October
1859, was United States minister to France. In this capacity
he attracted attention by wearing at the court of Napoleon III.
a simple diplomatic uniform (for this he was rebuked by
Secretary of State W. L. Marcy, who had ordered American
ministers to wear a plain civilian costume), and by joining with
James Buchanan and Pierre Soulé, ministers to Great Britain
and Spain respectively, in drawing up (Oct. 1854) the famous
Ostend Manifesto. Hawthorne called him a &ldquo;fat-brained,
good-hearted, sensible old man&rdquo;; and in politics he was a
typical Virginian of the old school, a state&rsquo;s rights Democrat,
upholding slavery and hating abolitionism.</p>

was born in Kidderminster on the 23rd of February 1795,
the son of a carpet-weaver. He began life as a street hawker
of cakes, fruits and vegetables. After trying his hand in his
native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing,
house-painting and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1814 to
Birmingham. Here he found employment in the gilt-toy trade.
In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of
split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the
making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens
being supplied through James Perry, the London stationer
whose name they bore, he was less well known than Joseph
Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest
producer in England. In 1874 the business was converted
into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade
Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating,
copper-smelting, and india-rubber ring making, in conjunction
with George R. Elkington. Mason was almost entirely self-educated,
having taught himself to write when a shoemaker&rsquo;s
apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It
was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage
at Erdington, near Birmingham. Upon it he expended about
£300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted
in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native
town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880 Mason College,
since incorporated in the university of Birmingham, was opened,
the total value of the endowment being about £250,000. Mason
died on the 16th of June 1881.</p>

Mason, vicar of Holy Trinity, Hull, was born on the 12th of
February 1725, was educated at St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
and took holy orders. In 1744 he wrote <i>Musaeus</i>, a lament
for Pope in imitation of <i>Lycidas</i>, and in 1749 through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page841" id="page841"></a>841</span>
influence of Thomas Gray he was elected a fellow of Pembroke
College. He became a devoted friend and admirer of Gray,
who addressed him as &ldquo;Skroddles,&rdquo; and corrected the worst
solecisms in his verses. In 1748 he published <i>Isis</i>, a poem
directed against the supposed Jacobitism of the university of
Oxford, which provoked Thomas Warton&rsquo;s <i>Triumph of Isis</i>.
Mason conceived the ambition of reconciling modern drama
with ancient forms by strict observance of the unities and the
restoration of the chorus. These ideas were exemplified in
<i>Elfrida</i> (1752) and <i>Caractacus</i> (1759), two frigid performances
no doubt intended to be read rather than acted, but produced
with some alterations at Covent Garden in 1772 and 1776
respectively. Horace Walpole described <i>Caractacus</i> as &ldquo;laboured,
uninteresting, and no more resembling the manners
of Britons than of Japanese&rdquo;; while Gray declared he had read
the manuscript &ldquo;not with pleasure only, but with emotion.&rdquo;
In 1754 Mason was presented to the rectory of Aston, near
Rotherham, Yorkshire, and in 1757 through the influence of
the duke of Devonshire he became one of the king&rsquo;s chaplains.
He also received the prebend of Holme in York Minster (1756),
was made canon residentiary in 1762, and in 1763 became
precentor and prebendary of Driffield. He married in 1764
Mary Sherman, who died three years later. When Gray died
in 1771 he made Mason his literary executor. In the preparation
of the <i>Life and Letters of Gray</i>, which appeared in 1774, he had
much help from Horace Walpole, with whom he corresponded
regularly until 1784 when Mason opposed Fox&rsquo;s India Bill,
and offended Walpole by thrusting on him political advice
unasked. Twelve years of silence followed, but in the year
before his death the correspondence was renewed on friendly
terms. Mason died at Aston on the 7th of April 1797.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His correspondence with Gray and Walpole shows him to have
been a man of cultivated tastes. He was something of an antiquarian,
a good musician, and an amateur of painting. He is said
to have invented an instrument called the celestina, a modified
pianoforte. Gray rewarded his faithful admiration with good-humoured
kindness. He warned him against confounding Mona
with the Isle of Man, or the Goths with the Celts, corrected his
grammar, pointed out his plagiarisms, and laughed gently at his
superficial learning. His powers show to better advantage in
the unacknowledged satirical poems which he produced under the
pseudonym of Malcolm Macgregor. In editing Gray&rsquo;s letters he
took considerable liberties with his originals, and did not print all
that related to himself.</p>

<p>Mason&rsquo;s other works included <i>Odes</i> (1756); <i>The English Garden</i>,
a didactic poem in blank verse, the four books of which appeared
in 1772, 1777, 1779 and 1782; <i>An Heroic Epistle to Sir William
Chambers</i> (1774); an <i>Ode to Mr Pinchbeck</i> (1776) and an <i>Epistle
to Dr Shebbeare</i> (1777)&mdash;all these by &ldquo;Malcolm Macgregor&rdquo;; <i>Essay,
Historical and Critical, of Church Music</i> (1795), and a lyrical drama,
<i>Sappho</i> (1797).</p>

<p>His poems were collected in 1764 and 1774, and an edition of his
<i>Works</i> appeared in 1811. His poems with a <i>Life</i> are included in
Alexander Chalmers&rsquo;s <i>English Poets</i>. His correspondence with
Walpole was edited by J. Mitford in 1851; and his correspondence
with Gray by the same editor in 1853. See also the standard editions
of the letters of Gray and of Walpole. There is a very pleasant
picture of Mason&rsquo;s character in Southey&rsquo;s <i>Doctor</i> (ch. cxxvi.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASON AND DIXON LINE,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> in America, the boundary line
(lat. 39° 43&prime; 26.3&Prime; N.) between Maryland and Pennsylvania,
U.S.A.; popularly the line separating &ldquo;free&rdquo; states and &ldquo;slave&rdquo;
states before the Civil War. The line derives its name from
Charles Mason (1730-1787) and Jeremiah Dixon, two English
astronomers, whose survey of it to a point about 244 m. west
of the Delaware between 1763 and 1767<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> marked the close of
the protracted boundary dispute (arising upon the grant of
Pennsylvania to William Penn in 1681) between the Baltimores
and Penns, proprietors respectively of Maryland and
Pennsylvania. The dispute arose from the designation, in the
grant to Penn, of the southern boundary of Pennsylvania mainly
as the parallel marking the &ldquo;beginning of the fortieth degree
of Northerne Latitude,&rdquo; after the northern boundary of Maryland
had been defined as a line &ldquo;which lieth under the fortieth
degree of north latitude from the equinoctial.&rdquo; The eastern
part of the line as far as Sideling Hill in the western part of the
present Washington county, was originally marked with milestones
brought from England, every fifth of which bore on one
side the arms of Baltimore and on the opposite side those of
Penn; but the difficulties in transporting them to the westward
were so great that many of them were not set up. Owing to the
removal of the stone marking the north-east corner of Maryland,
this point was again determined and marked in 1849-1850 by
Lieut.-Colonel J. D. Graham of the U.S. topographical engineers;
and as the western part of the boundary was not marked by
stones, and local disputes arose, the line was again surveyed
between 1901 and 1903 under the direction of a commission
appointed by Pennsylvania and Maryland.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The use of the term &ldquo;Mason and Dixon Line&rdquo; to designate the
boundary between the free and the slave states (and in general
between the North and the South) dates from the debates in Congress
over the Missouri Compromise in 1819-1820. As so used it
may be defined as not only the Mason and Dixon Line proper, but
also the line formed by the Ohio River from its intersection with the
Pennsylvania boundary to its mouth, thence the eastern, northern
and western boundaries of Missouri, and thence westward the
parallel 36° 30&prime;&mdash;the line established by the Missouri Compromise
to separate free and slave territory in the &ldquo;Louisiana Purchase,&rdquo;
except as regards Missouri. It is to be noted, however, that the
Missouri Compromise did not affect the territory later acquired
from Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASONRY,<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span><a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the art of building in stone. The earliest remains
(apart from the primitive work in rude stone&mdash;see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stone Monuments</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archaeology</a></span>, &amp;c.) are those of the ancient temples of
India and Egypt. Many of these early works were constructed
of stones of huge size, and it still remains a mystery how the
ancients were able to quarry and raise to a considerable height
above the ground blocks seven or eight hundred tons in weight.
Many of the early buildings of the middle ages were entirely
constructed of masses of concrete, often faced with a species of
rough cast. The early masonry seems to have been for the most
part worked with the axe and not with the chisel. A very excellent
example of the contrast between the earlier and later
Norman masonry may be seen in the choir of Canterbury Cathedral.
In those times the groining was frequently filled in with a
light tufa stone, said by some to have been brought from Italy,
but more probably from the Rhine. The Normans imported a
great quantity of stone from Caen, it being easily worked, and
particularly fit for carving. The freestones of England were
also much used; and in the first Pointed period, Purbeck and
Bethersden marbles were employed for column shafts, &amp;c. The
methods of working and setting stone were much the same as
at present, except that owing to difficulties of conveyance the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page842" id="page842"></a>842</span>
stones were used in much smaller sizes. As time went on the
art of masonry advanced till in England, in point of execution,
it at length rivalled that of any country.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Tools</i>.&mdash;The mason&rsquo;s tools may be grouped under five heads&mdash;hammers
and mallets, saws, chisels, setting-out and setting tools,
and hoisting appliances.</p>

<p>There are several different kinds of iron hammers used by the
stone worker; the mash hammer has a short handle and heavy head
for use with chisels; the iron hammer, used in carving,
in shape resembles a carpenter&rsquo;s mallet but is smaller;
<span class="sidenote">Hammers and Mallets.</span>
the waller&rsquo;s hammer is used for roughly shaping stones
in rubble work; the spalling hammer for roughly dressing stones
in the quarry; the scabbling-hammer, for the same purpose, has
one end pointed for use on hard stone; the pick has a long head
pointed at both ends, weighs from 14 to 20 &#8468;, and is used for
rough dressing and splitting; the axe has a double wedge-shaped head
and is used to bring stones to a fairly level face preparatory to their
being worked smooth; the patent axe, or patent hammer, is formed
with a number of plates with sharpened edges bolted together to
form a head; the mallet of hard wood is used for the finishing chisel
work and carving; and the dummy is of similar shape but smaller.</p>


<p>A hand saw similar to that used by the carpenter is used for
cutting small soft stones. Larger blocks are cut with the two-handed
<span class="sidenote">Saws.</span>
saw worked by two men. For the largest blocks the
frame saw is used, and is slung by a rope and pulleys
fitted with balance weights to relieve the operator of its weight.
The blade is of plain steel, the cutting action being supplied by sand
with water as a lubricant constantly applied.</p>

<p>There are perhaps even more varieties of chisels than of hammers.
The point and the punch have very small cutting edges, a quarter
of an inch or less in width. The former is used on the
harder and the latter on the softer varieties of stone
<span class="sidenote">Chisels.</span>
after the rough hammer dressing. The pitching tool has a wide
thick edge and is used in rough dressing. Jumpers are shafts of steel
having a widened edge, and are used for boring holes in hard stone.
Chisels are made with edges from a quarter-inch to one and a half
inches wide; those that exceed this width are termed boasters. The
claw chisel has a number of teeth from one-eighth to three-eighths
wide, and is used on the surface of hard stones after the point has been
used. The drag is a semi-circular steel plate, the straight edge having
teeth cut on it. It is used to level down the surfaces of soft stones.
Cockscombs are used for the same purpose on mouldings and are
shaped to various curves. Wedges of various sizes are used in
splitting stones and are inserted either in holes made with the
jumper or in chases cut with the stone-pick.</p>

<p>The implements for setting out the work are similar to those used,
by the bricklayer and other tradesmen, comprising the
<span class="sidenote">Setting-out and Setting Tools.</span>
rule, square, set square, the bevel capable of being set to
any required angle, compasses, spirit level, plumb-rule
and bob and mortar trowels. Gauges and moulds are
required in sinking moulds to the proper section.</p>

<p>The <i>nippers</i> (fig. 1), or <i>scissors</i>, as they are sometimes termed,
have two hooked arms fitting into notches in the opposite sides of
the block to be lifted. These arms are riveted together
in the same way as a pair of scissors, the upper ends
<span class="sidenote">Hoisting Appliances.</span>
having rings attached for the insertion of a rope or
chain which when pulled tight in the operation of lifting causes the
hooked ends to grip the stone. <i>Lewises</i> (fig. 2.) are wedge-shaped
pieces of steel which are fitted into a dovetailed mortise in the stone
to be hoisted. They are also used for setting blocks too large to
be set by hand, and are made in several forms. These are the usual
methods of securing the stone to the hoisting rope or chain, the hoisting
being effected by a pulley and fall, by a crane, or by other means.</p>

<p><i>Scaffolding</i>.&mdash;For rubble walls single scaffolds, resting partly on
the walls, similar to those used for brickwork (<i>q.v.</i>), are employed;
for ashlar and other gauged stonework (see below) self-supporting
scaffolds are used with a second set of standards and ledgers erected
close to the wall, the whole standing entirely independent. The
reason for the use of this double scaffold is that otherwise holes for
the putlogs to rest in would have to be left in the wall, and obviously
in an ashlar stone wall it would be impossible properly to make these
good on the removal of the scaffold (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Scaffold</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Seasoning Stone</i>.&mdash;Stone freshly quarried is full of sap, and thus
admits of being easily worked. On being exposed to the air the sap
dries out, and the stone becomes much harder in consequence.
For this reason, and because carriage charges are lessened by the
smaller bulk of the worked stone as compared with the rough block,
the stone for a building is often specified to be quarry-worked.
Vitruvius recommended that stone should be quarried in summer
when driest, and that it should be seasoned by being allowed to lie
two years before being used, so as to allow the natural sap to evaporate.
In the erection of St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren
required that the stone after being quarried should be exposed for
three years on the sea-beach before its introduction into the building.</p>

<p>The regular and determined form of bricks makes it to a large
extent a matter of practice to enable a man to become a good bricklayer,
but beyond these a continual exercise of judgment is required
of the workman in stone, who has for the most part to deal with
masses of all forms and of all sizes.</p>

<p><i>Setting Stones</i>.&mdash;All beds and joints should be truly worked and
perfectly level. If the surface be convex it will give rise to wide unsightly
joints; if concave the weight thrown on the stone will rest on
the edges and probably cause them to &ldquo;flush&rdquo; or break off and disfigure
the work. Large stones are placed in position with the aid
of hoisting appliances and should be tried in position before being
finally set. Great care should be taken to avoid fracturing or chipping
the stone in the process of handling, as it is impossible to make
good such damage. All stratified stones&mdash;and this includes by far
the largest proportion of building stones&mdash;when set in a level position
should be laid on their natural bed, <i>i.e.</i> with their laminae horizontal.
The greatest strength of a stone is obtained when the laminae lie
at right angles to the pressure placed upon it. In the case of arches
these layers should be parallel with the centre line of the voussoirs
and at right angles to the face of the arch. For cornices (except the
corner-stones) and work of a like nature, the stone is set with the
laminae on edge and perpendicular to the face of the work. With
many stones it is easy to determine the bed by moistening with water,
when the laminae will become apparent. Some stones, however,
it is impossible to read in this way, and it is therefore advisable to
have them marked in the quarry. A horizontal line in a quarry
does not in all cases give the proper bed of the stone, for since the
deposits were made ages ago natural upheavals have possibly occurred
to alter the &ldquo;lie&rdquo; of the material.</p>

<p>For the shafts of columns especially it is necessary to have the
layers horizontally placed, and a stone should be selected from a
quarry with a bed of the required depth. An example of the omission
of this precaution is visible in the arcading of the Royal Courts
of Justice, London, where the small shafts of the front arcade in
red sandstone have been turned with the laminae in a vertical position,
with the result that nearly every shaft is flaking away or is
cracked.</p>

<p><i>Use of Mortar</i>.&mdash;See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brickwork</a></span>. Of whatever quality the stone
may be of which a wall is built, it should consist as much of stone and
as little of mortar as possible. Only fine mortar is admissible if we
are to obtain as thin joints as possible. The joints should be well
raked out and pointed in Portland cement mortar. This applies
only to some sandstones, as marbles and many limestones are stained
by the use of Portland cement. For these a special cement must be
employed, composed of plaster of Paris, lime, and marble or
stone-dust.</p>

<p><i>Bonding</i>.&mdash;Bond (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brickwork</a></span>) is of not less importance in
stone walling than in brickwork. In ashlar-work the work is bonded
uniformly, the joints being kept perpendicularly one over the other;
but in rubble-work, instead of making the joints recur one over the
other in alternate courses they should be carefully made to lock,
so as to give the strength of two or three courses or layers between a
joint in one course and the joint that next occurs vertically above
it in another course. In the through or transverse bonding of a
wall a good proportion of header stones running about two-thirds
of the distance through the width of the wall should be provided to
bind the whole structure together. The use of through stones,
<i>i.e.</i> stones running through the whole thickness of the wall from front
to back, is not to be recommended. Such stones are liable to fracture
and convey damp to the internal face.</p>

<p><i>Slip Joints</i>.&mdash;As with brickwork so in masonry great care must be
exercised to prevent the different parts of a building settling unequally.
When two portions of a building differing considerably in
height come together, it is usual to employ a slip or housed joint
instead of bonding the walls into each other. This arrangement
allows the heavier work to settle to a greater extent than the low
portion without causing any defect in the stones.</p>

<p><i>Footings</i>.&mdash;The footings of stone walls should consist of large stones
of even thickness proportionate to their length; if possible they
should be the full breadth in one piece. Each course should be well
bedded and levelled.</p>

<p><i>Walling</i>.&mdash;There are broadly speaking two classes of stone walling:
rubble and ashlar. Rubble walls are built of stones more or less
irregular in shape and size and coarsely jointed. Ashlar walls are
constructed of carefully worked blocks of regular dimensions and set
with fine joints.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;(¼ in. = 1 ft.)</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Random Rubble</i> (fig. 3) is the roughest form of stonework. It is
built with irregular pieces of stone usually less than 9 in. thick,
loosely packed without much regard to courses, the interstices
between the large stones being occupied by small ones, the remaining
crevices filled up with mortar. Bond stones or headers should be
used frequently in every course. This form of walling is much used
in stone districts for boundary walls and is often set dry without
mortar. For this work the mason uses no tool but the trowel to lay
on the mortar, the scabbling hammer to break off the most repulsive
irregularities from the stone, and the plumb-rule to keep his work
perpendicular.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;(¼ in. = 1 ft.)</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Coursed Rubble</i> (fig. 4) is levelled up in courses 12 or 18 in.
deep, the depth varying in different courses according to the sizes
of the stones. The stones are dressed by the workman before
he begins building, to obtain a fairly level bed and perpendicular
face.</p>

<p><i>Irregularly Coursed Squared Rubble</i> is a development of uncoursed
random rubble, the stones in this case being squared with the
hammer and roughly faced up with the axe. The courses jump
abruptly from one level to another as the sizes of the blocks demand;
the interstices are filled in with small pieces of stone called &ldquo;snecks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For <i>Coursed Squared Rubble</i> the stone is faced in a similar manner
and set in courses, the depth of each course being made up of one
or more stones.</p>

<p>In <i>Regular Coursed Rubble</i> all the stones in one course are of the
same height.</p>

<p><i>Block-in-course</i> is the name applied to a form of stone walling that
has some of the characteristics of ashlar but the execution of which
is much rougher. The courses are usually less than 12 in. high.
It is much used by engineers for waterside and railway work where a
good appearance is desired.</p>

<p>The <i>Angles</i> or <i>Quoins</i> of rubble-work are always carefully and
precisely worked and serve as a gauge for the rest of the walling.
Frequently the quoins and jambs are executed in ashlar, which
gives a neat and finished appearance and adds strength to the work.</p>

<p>The name <i>Ashlar</i> is given, without regard to the finish of the
face of the stone, to walling composed of stones carefully dressed,
from 12 to 18 in. deep, the mortar joints being about an eighth of
an inch or less in thickness. No stone except the hardest should
exceed in length three times its depth when required to resist a
heavy load and its breadth should be from one and a half to three
times its depth. The hardest stone may have a length equal to
four or perhaps five times its depth and a width three times its depth.
The face of ashlar-work may be plain and level, or have rebated,
chamfered, or moulded joints.</p>

<p>The great cost of this form of stonework renders the employment
of a backing of an inferior nature very general. This backing varies
according to the district in which the building operations
are being carried on, being rubble stonework in stone
<span class="sidenote">Backing to Stonework.</span>
districts and brick or concrete elsewhere, the whole
being thoroughly tied together both transversely and longitudinally
with bondstones. In England a stone much used for backing ashlar
and Kentish rag rubble-work is a soft sandstone called &ldquo;hassock.&rdquo;
In the districts where it is quarried it is much cheaper than brickwork.
(For brickbacking see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brickwork</a></span>.) Ashlar facing usually
varies from 4 to 9 in. in thickness. The work must not be all of
one thickness, but should vary in order that effective bond with
the backing may be obtained. If the work is in courses of uneven
depth the narrow courses are made of the greater thickness and the
deep courses are narrow. It is sometimes necessary to secure the
stone facing back with iron ties, but this should be avoided wherever
possible, as they are liable to rust and split the stonework. When it
is necessary to use them they should be covered with some protective
coating. The use of a backing to a stone wall, besides lessening the
cost, gives a more equable temperature inside the building and prevents
the transmission of wet by capillary attraction to the interior,
which would take place if single stones were used for the entire
thickness.</p>

<p>All work of this description must be executed in Portland cement,
mortar of good strength, to avoid as much as possible the unequal
settlement of the deep courses of stone facing and the narrower
courses of the brick or rough stone backing. If the backing is of
brick it should never be less than 9 in. thick, and whether of stone
or brick it should be levelled up in courses of the same thickness as
the ashlar.</p>

<p>There are many different sorts of walling, or modes of structure,
arising from the nature of the materials available in various localities.
That is perhaps of most frequent occurrence in which
<span class="sidenote">Walling.</span>
either squared, broken, or round flints are used. This,
when executed with care, has a distinctly decorative appearance.
To give stability to the structure, lacing courses of tiles, bricks or
dressed stones are introduced, and brick or stone piers are built at
intervals, thus forming a flint panelled wall. The quoins, too, in
this type of wall are formed in dressed stone or brick work.</p>

<p>Uncoursed rubble built with irregular blocks of ragstone, an
unstratified rock quarried in Kent, is in great favour for facing the
external walls of churches and similar works (fig. 5).</p>

<p><i>Pointing</i>.&mdash;As with brickwork this is generally done when the work
is completed and before the scaffolding is removed. Suitable weather
should be chosen, for if the weather be either frosty or too hot the
pointing will suffer. The joints are raked out to a depth of half an
inch or more, well wetted, and then refilled with a fine mortar composed
specially to resist the action of the weather. This is finished
flat or compressed with a special tool to a shaped joint, the usual
forms of which are shown in fig. 6.</p>

<p><i>Stonewash</i>.&mdash;To give a uniform appearance to the stonework
and preserve the finished face until a hardened skin has formed, it is
usual to coat the surface of exposed masonry with a protective
compound of ordinary limewhite with a little size mixed in it, or a
special mixture of stone-dust, lime, salt, whiting and size with a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page844" id="page844"></a>844</span>
ochre to tone it down. After six months or more the work is cleaned
down with water and stiff bristle or wire brushes. Sometimes
muriatic acid much diluted with water is used.</p>

<p><i>Technical Terms.</i>&mdash;Of the following technical terms, many will be
found embodied in the drawing of a gable wall (fig. 7), which shows
the manner and position in which many different members are used.</p>

two sloping sides; it is sometimes termed a &ldquo;saddle&rdquo; (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Bed.</i>&mdash;The <i>bed</i> surface upon which a stone is set or bedded should
be worked truly level in every part. Many workmen to form a neat
thin joint with a minimum amount of labour hollow the bed and
thus when the stone is set all weight is thrown upon the edges with
the frequent result that these are crushed.</p>

<p><i>Coping.</i>&mdash;The <i>coping</i> or <i>capping</i> stones are placed on the top of
walls not covered by a roof, spanning their entire width and throwing
off the rain and snow, thus keeping the interior of the wall dry.
The fewer the number of joints the better the security, and for this
reason it is well to form copings with as long stones as possible.
To throw water off clear, and prevent it from running down the face
of the wall, the coping should project an inch or two on each side and
have a throat worked on the under-side of the projections (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Cornice,</i> a projecting course of moulded stone crowning a structure,
forming a cap or finish and serving to throw any wet clear of the walls.
A deep drip should always be worked in the upper members of a
cornice to prevent the rain trickling down and disfiguring the face
of the moulding and the wall below (fig. 8).</p>

<p><i>Corbel,</i> a stone built into a wall and projecting to form a cantilever,
supporting a load beyond the face of the wall. It is frequently
richly ornamented by carving (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Skew Corbel,</i> a stone placed at the base of the sloping side of a
gable wall to resist any sliding tendency of the sloping coping. Stones
placed for a similar purpose at intervals along the sloping side,
tailing into the wall, are termed &ldquo;kneelers&rdquo; and have the section
of the coping worked upon them (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Corbel Table,</i> a lino of small corbels placed at short distances apart
supporting a parapet or arcade. This forms an ornamental feature
which was much employed in early Gothic times. It probably
originates from the machicolations of ancient fortresses.</p>

<p><i>Dressings,</i> the finished stones of window and door jambs and
quoins. For example, a &ldquo;brick building with stone dressings&rdquo;
would have brick walls with stone door and window jambs, heads
and sills, and perhaps also stone quoins (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Diaper,</i> a square pattern formed on the face of the stonework by
means of stones of different colours and varieties or by patterns
carved on the surface (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Finial,</i> a finishing ornament applied usually to a gable end (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Gablet,</i> small gable-shaped carved panels frequently used in Gothic
stonework for apex stones, and in spires, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Gargoyle,</i> a detail, not often met with in modern work, which
consists of a waterspout projecting so as to throw the rain-water
from the gutters clear of the walls. In early work it was often
carved into grotesque shapes of animal and other forms.</p>

<p><i>Galleting.</i>&mdash;The joints of rubble are sometimes enriched by having
small pebbles or chips of flint pressed into the mortar whilst green.
The joints are then said to be &ldquo;galleted.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Jamb.</i>&mdash;Window and door jambs should always be of dressed
stone, both on account of the extra strength thus gained and in
order to give a finish to the work. The stones are laid alternately
as stretchers and headers; the former are called outbands, the latter
inbands (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Label Moulding,</i> a projecting course of stone running round an
arch. When not very large it is sometimes cut on the voussoirs,
but is usually made a separate course of stone. Often, and especially
in the case of door openings, a small sinking is worked on the top
surface of the moulding to form a gutter which leads to the sides
any water that trickles down the face of the wall.</p>

<p><i>Lacing Stone.</i>&mdash;This is placed as a voussoir in brick arches of
wide span, and serves to bond or lace several courses together (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brickwork</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Lacing Course,</i> a course of dressed stone, bricks or tiles, run at
intervals in a wall of rubble or flint masonry to impart strength and
tie the whole together (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Long and Short Work,</i> a typical Saxon method of arranging quoin
stones, flat slabs and long narrow vertical stones being placed alternately.
Earls Barton church in Northamptonshire is an example
of their use in old work. In modern work long and short work,
sometimes termed &ldquo;block and start,&rdquo; is little used (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Parapet,</i> a fence wall at the top of a wall at the eaves of the roof.
The gutter lies behind, and waterways are formed through the
parapet wall for the escape of the rain-water.</p>

<p><i>Plinth,</i> a projecting base to a wall serving to give an appearance
of stability to the work.</p>

<p><i>Quoin,</i> the angle at the junction of two walls. Quoins are often
executed in dressed stone (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Rag-bolt,</i> the end of an iron bolt when required to be let into
stone is roughed or ragged. A dovetailed
mortise is prepared in the stone and the
ragged end of the bolt placed in this,
and the mortise filled in with molten lead
or sand and sulphur (fig. 9).</p>

<p><i>Sill,</i> the stone which forms a finish to
the wall at the bottom of an opening. Sills
should always be weathered, slightly in
the case of door sills, more sharply for
windows, and throated on the under side
to throw off the wet. The weathering is
not carried through the whole length of the
sill, but a stool is left on at each end to
form a square end for building in (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>String Courses,</i> horizontal bands of stone, either projecting beyond
or flush with the face of the wall and often moulded or carved.
They are frequently continuations of the sills or head lines of windows
(figs. 5 and 7).</p>

<p><i>Scontion.</i>&mdash;In a thick wall the dressed stones forming the inside
angles of the jamb of a window or door opening are termed scontions.</p>

<p><i>Spalls,</i> small pieces chipped off whilst working a stone.</p>

<p><i>Templates,</i> slabs of hard stone set in a wall to take the ends of a
beam or girder so as to distribute the load over a larger area of the
wall.</p>

<p><i>Tympanum,</i> the triangular filling of masonry in a pediment between
the cornices, or between the horizontal head of a window or
door and the under-side of the relieving arch above it. It is often
panelled or enriched with carved ornament (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Throat,</i> a groove worked on the under-side of projecting external
members to intercept rain-water and cause it to drop off the member
clear of the work beneath (fig. 8).</p>

<p><i>Weathering.</i>&mdash;The surface of an exposed stone is weathered when
it is worked to a slope so as to throw off the water. Cornices,
copings, sills and string courses should all be so weathered.</p>

<p><i>Voussoirs,</i> the wedge-shaped blocks of which an arch is built up.</p>

<p><i>Methods of finishing Face of Stones.</i>&mdash;The <i>self face</i> or <i>quarry face</i>
is the natural surface formed when the stone is detached from the
mass in the quarry or when a stone is split.</p>

<p><i>Saw-face,</i> the surface formed by sawing.</p>

<p><i>Hammer-dressed, Rock-faced, or Pitch-faced.</i>&mdash;This face is used for
ashlar-work, usually with a chisel-draughted margin around each
block. It gives a very massive and solid appearance to the lower
storeys of masonry buildings, and is formed with little labour, and is
therefore the cheapest face to adopt for ashlar-work (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Broached and Pointed Work.</i>&mdash;This face is also generally used with
a chisel-draughted margin. The stone as left from the scabbling
hammer at the quarry has its rocky face worked down to an approximate
level by the point. In broached work the grooves made by the
tool are continuous, often running obliquely across the face of the
block. In pointed work the lines are not continuous; the surface is
rough or fine pointed according as the point is used over every inch
or half-inch of the stone. The point is used more upon hard stones
than soft ones (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Tooth-chiselled Work.</i>&mdash;The cheapest method of dressing soft stones
is by the toothed chisel which gives a surface very much like the
pointed work of hard stones.</p>

<p><i>Droved Work.</i>&mdash;This surface is obtained with a chisel about two
and a half inches wide, no attempt being made to keep the cuts in
continuous lines.</p>

<p><i>Tooled Work</i> is somewhat similar to droved work and is done with
a flat chisel, the edge of which is about four inches wide, care being
taken to make the cuts in continuous lines across the width of the
stone.</p>

<p><i>Combed or Dragged Work.</i>&mdash;For soft stones the steel comb or drag
is often employed to remove all irregularities from the face and thus
form a fine surface. These tools are specially useful for moulded
work, as they are formed to fit a variety of curves.</p>

<p><i>Rubbed Work.</i>&mdash;For this finish the surface of the stone is previously
brought with the chisel to a level and approximately smooth face,
and then the surface is rubbed until it is quite smooth with a piece
of grit stone aided by fine sand and water as a lubricant. Marbles
are polished by being rubbed with gritstone, then with pumice, and
lastly with emery powder.</p>

<p>Besides these, the most usual methods of finishing the faces of
stonework, there are several kinds of surface formed with hammers
or axes of various descriptions. These types of hammers are more
used on the continent of Europe and in America perhaps than in
England, but they deserve notice here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page846" id="page846"></a>846</span></p>

<p>The <i>toothed axe</i> has its edges divided into teeth, fine or coarse
according to the work to be done. It is used to reduce the face of
limestones and sandstones to a condition ready for the chisel. The
<i>bush hammer</i> has a heavy square-shaped double-faced head, upon
which are cut projecting pyramidal points. It is used to form a surface
full of little holes, and with it the face of sand and limestones
may be brought to a somewhat ornamental finish. The <i>patent
hammer</i> is used on granite and other hard rocks, which have been
first dressed to a medium surface with the point. The fineness of
the result is determined by the number of blades in the hammer, and
the work is said to be &ldquo;six,&rdquo; &ldquo;eight&rdquo; or &ldquo;ten-cut&rdquo; work according
to the number of blades inserted or bolted in the hammer head.
The <i>crandall</i> has an iron handle slotted at one end with a hole <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in.
wide and 3 in. long. In this slot are fixed by a key ten or eleven
double-headed points of ¼ in. square steel about 9 in. long. It is
used for finishing sandstone and soft stones after the surface has been
levelled down with the axe or chisel. It gives a fine pebbly sparkling
appearance.</p>

<p>There are several methods of finishing stone which involve a great
deal of labour and are therefore expensive to work, but which result
in imparting a very stiff and unnatural appearance to the masonry.</p>

<p><i>Vermiculated Work.</i>&mdash;This is formed by carving a number of curling
worm-like lines over the face of the block, sinking in between the
worms to a depth of a fourth of an inch. The surface of the strings
is worked smooth, and the sinkings are pock-marked with a pointed
tool (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Furrowed Work.</i>&mdash;In this face the stone is cut with a chisel into a
number of small parallel grooves or furrows (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Reticulated Face</i> is a finish somewhat similar to vermiculated work,
but the divisions are more nearly squares.</p>

<p><i>Face Joints of Ashlar.</i>&mdash;The face joints of ashlar stonework are
often sunk or rebated to form what are termed rusticated joints;
sometimes the angles of each block are moulded or chamfered to
give relief to the surface or to show a massive effect (fig. 7).</p>

<p><i>Joints in Stonework.</i>&mdash;The joints between one block of stone and
another are formed in many ways by cramps, dowels and joggles
of various descriptions.</p>

<p>The stones of copings, cornices and works of a similar nature, are
often tied together with metal cramps to check any tendency for the
stones to separate under the force of the wind (figs. 10
and 11). Cramps are made of iron (plain or galvanized),
<span class="sidenote">Cramps.</span>
copper or gun-metal, of varying sections and lengths to suit the work.
A typical cramp would be about 9 in. long, 1 or 1½ in. wide, and from
¼ to ½ in. thick, and turned down about 1½ in. at each end. A dovetailed
mortise is formed at a suitable point in each of the stones to
be joined and connected by a chase. The cramp is placed in this
channel with its turned-down ends in the mortises, and it is then
fixed with molten lead, sulphur and sand, or Portland cement. Lead
shrinks on cooling, and if used at all should be well caulked when
cold. Double dovetailed slate cramps bedded in Portland cement
are occasionally used (fig. 11).</p>

<p>Dowels are used for connecting stones where the use of cramps
<span class="sidenote">Dowels.</span>
would be impracticable, as in the joints of window mullions, the shafts
of small columns, and in similar works (figs. 7, 8 and 20).
Dowels for bed and side joints may be used. They are
of slate, metal, or sometimes of hard wood.</p>

<p>There are many ways of making a joggle joint. The joggle may
be worked on one of the stones so
as to fit into a groove
in the adjoining stone,
or grooves may be cut in both the
stones and an independent joggle
<span class="sidenote">Joggles.</span>
of slate, pebbles, or Portland cement
fitted, the joggle being really
a kind of dowel. The pebble
joggle joint is formed with the aid
of pebbles as small dowels fitted
into mortises in the jointing faces
of two stones and set with Portland
cement; but joggles of slate
have generally taken the place of
pebbles. Portland cement joggles
are formed by pouring cement
grout into a vertical or oblique
mortise formed by cutting a groove
in each of the joining surfaces of the
stones. What is known as a he-and-she
joggle, worked on the edges of the stones themselves, is
shown in fig. 13.</p>

<p>Plugs or dowels of lead are formed by pouring molten lead through
a channel into dovetailed mortises in each stone (figs. 14 and 15).
When cold the metal is caulked to compress it tightly into the
holes.</p>

<p>The saddle joint is used for cornices, and is formed when a portion
of the stone next the joint is left raised so as to guide rain-water
away from the joint (fig. 8).</p>

<p>Two forms of rebated joints for
stone copings and roofs are common.
In one form (shown in fig. 7)
the stones forming the coping are
thicker at their lower and rebated
edge than at the top plain edge,
giving a stepped surface. The other
form has a level surface and the stone
is of the same thickness throughout
and worked to a rebate on top and
bottom edges. In laying stone roofs
the joints are usually lapped over with
an upper slab of stone.</p>

<p><i>Joints in Spires.</i>&mdash;Four forms of jointing for the battering stonework
of spires are shown in fig. 16. <b>A</b> is a plain horizontal joint.
<b>B</b> is a similar joint formed at right angles to the face of the
work. This is the most economical form of joint, the stone being
cut with its sides square with each other; but if the mortar
in the joint decay moisture is allowed to penetrate. With these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page847" id="page847"></a>847</span>
forms dowelling is frequently necessary for greater stability. The
joints <b>C</b> and <b>D</b> are more elaborate and much more expensive on
account of the extra labour involved in working and fitting.</p>

<p>Where a concentrated weight is
carried by piers or columns the bed
joints are in many cases formed without
the use of mortar, a thin sheet
of milled lead being placed between
the blocks of stone to fill up any slight
inequalities.</p>

<p><i>Moulded Work.</i>&mdash;The working of
mouldings in stone is an important
part of the mason&rsquo;s craft, and forms
a costly item in the erection of a stone
structure. Much skill and care is required
to retain the arrises sharp and
the curved members of accurate and
proportionate outline. As in the case
of wood mouldings, machinery now
plays an important part in the preparation
of stone moulded work. The
process of working a stone by hand
labour is as follows: The profile of
the moulding is marked on to a zinc
template on opposite ends of the
stone to be worked; a short portion, an inch or two in length
termed a &ldquo;draught,&rdquo; is at each end worked to the required section.
The remaining portion is then proceeded with, the craftsman continually
checking the accuracy of his work with a straight-edge and
zinc templates. A stone to be moulded by machinery is fixed to a
moving table placed under a shaped tool which is fixed in an immovable
portion of the machine, and is so adjusted as to cut or chip off
a small layer of stone. Each time the stone passes under the cutter
it is automatically moved a trifle nearer, and thus it gradually
reduces the stone until
the required shape is
attained.</p>

<p><i>Iron in Stonework.</i>&mdash;The
use of iron dowels or
cramps in stonework,
unless entirely and permanently
protected from
oxidation is attended by
the gravest risks; for
upon the expansion of
the iron by rusting the
stone may split, and
perhaps bring about a
more or less serious
failure in that portion
of the building. A case
in point is that of the
church of St Mary-le-Strand,
London, where
the ashlar facing was
secured to the backing
with iron cramps; these
were inefficiently protected
from damp, with
the result that many of the blocks have been split in consequence of
rusting. John Smeaton in his Eddystone Lighthouse used dowels
of Purbeck marble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page848" id="page848"></a>848</span></p>

<p><i>Stone Arches.</i>&mdash;Stone arches are very frequently used both in stone
and brick buildings. (For general definitions and terms see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brickwork</a></span>.)
They may be built in a great variety of styles, either flat,
segmental, circular, elliptical or pointed. Each block or voussoir
should be cut to fit exactly in its appointed place, the joints being
made as fine as possible. The joints should radiate from the centre
from which the soffit or intrados is struck, or in the case of an elliptical
arch they should be at right angles to a tangent drawn to the
intrados at that point. The extrados or back of the arch is usually
concentric with the intrados, but is sometimes made thicker in one
portion than in another; thus the arch may be deeper at the crown
than at the sides, or at the sides than in the centre. In some cases
two or more voussoirs are of one stone, having a false joint cut in
the centre; this is economical, and in some cases adds to the stability
of the arch. Generally the arch is divided into an uneven number
of voussoirs so as to give a keystone, the voussoirs being laid from
each side of the keystone and fitting exactly in the centre of the arch.
The keystone is not a necessity, arches being frequently formed with
an even number of voussoirs; some architects hold that the danger
of the voussoirs cracking is thereby lessened. Where lintels are used
in a stone wall over openings of small span it is usual to build a
relieving arch above to take the superincumbent weight of masonry;
or the same purpose may be effected in walls of ashlar by a flat
relieving or &ldquo;save&rdquo; arch, formed in the next course of three stones
above the lintel, the tapering keystone resting between the two side
stones which are tailed well into the wall.</p>

<p>In very many cases it is desired to form square heads to openings
of greater span than it is convenient to obtain lintels for in one piece,
and some form of flat arch must therefore be adopted. The voussoirs
are connected by joggles worked on their joints, as in fig. 17.
The weight of the superimposed wall is taken by a lintel with
relieving arch above at the back of the arch.</p>

<p>Arches built to an elliptical form when used for large spans (if
of flat curve they should bridge over 8 ft. or 10 ft.) are liable if
heavily loaded to fail by the voussoirs at the centre being forced
down, or else to burst up at the haunches. With arches of this
description there is a large amount of outward thrust, and abutments
of ample strength must be placed to receive the springers.</p>

<p><i>Stone Tracery.</i>&mdash;The designs of Gothic and other tracery stonework
are almost infinite, and there are many methods, ingenious and
otherwise, of setting out such work. Nearly all diagrams of construction
are planned on the principle of geometrical intersections.
In the example illustrated in fig. 18 the method of setting out and
finishing the design is very clearly shown, together with the best
positions for the joints of the various parts. The jointing is a
matter which must be carefully considered in order to avoid any
waste of stone and labour. It will be observed that the right-hand
side of the elevation shows the method of setting out the tracery
by the centre lines of the various intersecting branches, the other
half giving the completed design with the cusping drawn in and the
positions of joints. All the upper construction of windows and
doors and of aisle arches should be protected from superincumbent
pressure by strong relieving arches above the labels, as shown in
the figure, which should be worked with the ordinary masonry, and
so set that the weight above should avoid pressure on the fair
work, which would be liable to flush or otherwise destroy the joints
of the tracery.</p>

<p><i>Carving.</i>&mdash;Stone carving is a craft quite apart from the work of the
ordinary stonemason, and like carving in wood needs an artistic
feeling and special training. Carving-stone should be of fine grain
and sufficiently soft to admit of easy working. The Bath stones in
England and the Caen stone of France are largely used for internal
work, but if for the exterior they should be treated with some
chemical preservative. Carving is frequently done after the stone
is built into position, the face being left rough&mdash;&ldquo;boasted&rdquo;&mdash;and
projecting sufficiently for the intended design.</p>

<p><a name="ft1q" id="ft1q" href="#fa1q"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The English word &ldquo;mason&rdquo; is from the French, which appears
in the two forms, <i>machun</i> and <i>masson</i> (from the last comes the modern
Fr. form <i>maçon</i>, which means indifferently a bricklayer or mason).
In O. H. Ger. the word is <i>mezzo</i>, which survives in the German for a
stone-mason, <i>Steinmetz</i>. The med. Lat. form, <i>machio</i>, was connected
with <i>machina</i>&mdash;obviously a guess. The Low Lat., <i>macheria</i> or
<i>maceria</i> (see Du Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>, <i>s.v. macio</i>), a wall, has been
suggested as showing some connexion. Some popular Lat. form
as <i>macio</i> or <i>mattio</i> is probably the origin. No Teut. word, according
to the <i>New English Dictionary</i>, except that which appears in
&ldquo;mattock,&rdquo; seems to have any bearing on the ultimate origin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASPERO, GASTON CAMILLE CHARLES<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> (1846-&emsp;&emsp;),
French Egyptologist, was born in Paris on the 23rd of June
1846, his parents being of Lombard origin. While at school he
showed a special taste for history, and when fourteen years
old was already interested in hieroglyphic writing. It was
not until his second year at the École Normale in 1867 that
Maspero met with an Egyptologist in the person of Mariette,
who was then in Paris as commissioner for the Egyptian section
of the exhibition. Mariette gave him two newly discovered
hieroglyphic texts of considerable difficulty to study, and,
self-taught, the young scholar produced translations of them
in less than a fortnight, a great feat in those days when
Egyptology was still almost in its infancy. The publication of
these in the same year established his reputation. A short
time was spent in assisting a gentleman in Peru, who was
seeking to prove an Aryan affinity for the dialects spoken by
the Indians of that country, to publish his researches; but in
1868 Maspero was back in France at more profitable work.
In 1869 he became a teacher (<i>répétiteur</i>) of Egyptian language
and archaeology at the École des Hautes Études; in 1874 he
was appointed to the chair of Champollion at the Collège de
France.</p>

<p>In November 1880 Professor Maspero went to Egypt as head
of an archaeological mission despatched thither by the French
government, which ultimately developed into the well-equipped
Institut Français de l&rsquo;Archéologie Oriental. This was but a
few months before the death of Mariette, whom Maspero then
succeeded as director-general of excavations and of the antiquities
of Egypt. He held this post till June 1886; in these five years
he had organized the mission, and his labours for the Bulak
museum and for archaeology had been early rewarded by the
discovery of the great cache of royal mummies at Deir el-Bahri
in July 1881. Maspero now resumed his professorial duties in
Paris until 1899, when he returned to Egypt in his old capacity
as director-general of the department of antiquities. He found
the collections in the Cairo Museum enormously increased, and
he superintended their removal from Gizeh to the new quarters
at Kasr en-Nil in 1902. The vast catalogue of the collections
made rapid progress under Maspero&rsquo;s direction. Twenty-four
volumes or sections were already published in 1909. The repairs
and clearances at the temple of Karnak, begun in his previous
tenure of office, led to the most remarkable discoveries in later
years (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Karnak</a></span>), during which a vast amount of excavation
and exploration has been carried on also by unofficial but
authorized explorers of many nationalities.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among his best-known publications are the large <i>Histoire ancienne
des peuples de l&rsquo;Orient classique</i> (3 vols., Paris, 1895-1897, translated
into English by Mrs McClure for the S.P.C.K.), displaying
the history of the whole of the nearer East from the beginnings to
the conquest by Alexander; a smaller <i>Histoire des peuples de
l&rsquo;Orient</i>, 1 vol., of the same scope, which has passed through six
editions from 1875 to 1904; <i>Études de mythologie et d&rsquo;archéologie
égyptiennes</i> (Paris, 1893, &amp;c.), a collection of reviews and essays
originally published in various journals, and especially important
as contributions to the study of Egyptian religion; <i>L&rsquo;Archéologie
égyptienne</i> (latest ed., 1907), of which several editions have been
published in English. He also established the journal <i>Recueil de
travaux relatifs à la philologie et à l&rsquo;archéologie égyptiennes et
assyriennes</i>; the <i>Bibliothèque égyptologique</i>, in which the scattered
essays of the French Egyptologists are collected, with biographies,
&amp;c.; and the <i>Annales du service des antiquités de l&rsquo;Égypte</i>, a repository
for reports on official excavations, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Maspero also wrote: <i>Les Inscriptions des pyramides de Saqqaroh</i>
(Paris, 1894); <i>Les Momies royales de Deir el-Baharî</i> (Paris, 1889);
<i>Les Contes populaires de l&rsquo;Égypte ancienne</i> (3rd ed., Paris, 1906);

<p><span class="bold">MASS<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (O.E. <i>maesse</i>; Fr. <i>messe</i>; Ger. <i>Messe</i>; Ital. <i>messa</i>; from
eccl. Lat. <i>missa</i>), a name for the Christian eucharistic service,
practically confined since the Reformation to that of the Roman
Catholic Church. The various orders for the celebration of Mass
are dealt with under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liturgy</a></span>; a detailed account of the Roman
order is given under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Missal</a></span>; and the general development of the
eucharistic service, including the Mass, is described in the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eucharist</a></span>. The present article is confined (1) to the consideration
of certain special meanings which have become attached
to the word Mass and are the subject of somewhat acute controversy,
(2) to the Mass in music.</p>

<p>The origin of the word <i>missa</i>, as applied to the Eucharist, is
obscure. The first to discuss the matter is Isidore of Seville
(<i>Etym.</i> vi. 19), who mentions an &ldquo;evening office&rdquo; (<i>officium
vespertinum</i>), a &ldquo;morning office&rdquo; (<i>officium matutinum</i>), and an
office called <i>missa</i>. Of the latter he says: &ldquo;Missa tempore
sacrificii est, quando catechumeni foras mittuntur, clamante
levita &lsquo;si quis catechumenus remansit, exeat foras.&rsquo; Et inde
&lsquo;missa,&rsquo; quia sacramentis altaris interesse non possunt, qui nondum
regenerati sunt&rdquo; (&ldquo;The <i>missa</i> is at the time of the sacrifice,
when the catechumens are sent out, the deacon crying, &lsquo;If any
catechumen remain, let him go forth.&rsquo;&rdquo; Hence <i>missa</i>, because
those who are as yet unregenerate&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> unbaptized&mdash;may not
be present at the sacraments of the altar). This derivation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page849" id="page849"></a>849</span>
the word Mass, which would connect it with the special formula
of dismissal still preserved in the Roman liturgy&mdash;<i>Ite, missa est</i>&mdash;once
generally accepted, is now disputed. It is pointed out that
the word <i>missa</i> long continued to be applied to any church
service, and more particularly to the lections (see Du Cange for
numerous examples), and it is held that such services received
their name of <i>missal</i> from the solemn form of dismissal with which
it was customary to conclude them; thus, in the 4th century
<i>Pilgrimage of Etheria</i> (<i>Silvia</i>) the word <i>missa</i> is used indiscriminately
of the Eucharist, other services, and the ceremony
of dismissal. F. Kattenbusch (Herzog-Hauck, <i>Realencyklop.
s.</i> &ldquo;Messe&rdquo;) ingeniously, but with little evidence, suggests that
the word may have had a double origin and meaning: (1) in
the sense of <i>dimissio</i>, &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo;; (2) in that of <i>commissio</i>,
&ldquo;commission,&rdquo; &ldquo;official duty,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the exact Latin equivalent of
the Greek <span class="grk" title="leitourgia">&#955;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liturgy</a></span>), and hence the conflicting
use of the term. It is, however, far more probable that it was a
general term that gradually became crystallized as applying to
that service in which the dismissal represented a more solemn
function. In the narrower sense of &ldquo;Mass&rdquo; it is first found in
St Ambrose (<i>Ep.</i> 20, 4, ed. Ballerini): &ldquo;Missam facere coepi.
Dum offero ...&rdquo; which evidently identifies the <i>missa</i> with the
sacrifice. It continued, however, to be used loosely, though its tendency
to become proper only to the principal Christian service
is clear from a passage in the 12th homily of Caesarius, bishop
of Arles (d. 542): &ldquo;If you will diligently attend, you will recognize
that <i>missae</i> are not celebrated when the divine readings
are recited in the church, but when gifts are offered and the Body
and Blood of the Lord are consecrated.&rdquo; The complete service
(<i>missa ad integrum</i>), the bishop goes on to say, cannot be had at
home by reading and prayer, but only in the house of God,
where, besides the Eucharist, &ldquo;the divine word is preached and
the blessing is given to the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever its origin, the word Mass had by the time of the
Reformation been long applied only to the Eucharist; and,
though in itself a perfectly colourless term, and used as such during
the earlier stages of the 16th century controversies concerning
the Eucharist, it soon became identified with that sacrificial
aspect of the sacrament of the altar which it was the chief
object of the Reformers to overthrow. In England, so late as
the first Prayer-book of Edward VI., it remained one of the
official designations of the Eucharist, which is there described
as &ldquo;The Supper of the Lorde and holy Communion, commonly
called the Masse.&rdquo; This, however, like the service itself, represented
a compromise which the more extreme reformers would
not tolerate, and in the second Prayer-book, together with such
language in the canon as might imply the doctrine of transubstantiation
and of the sacrifice, the word Mass also disappears.
That this abolition of the word Mass, as implying the offering of
Christ&rsquo;s Body and Blood by the priest for the living and the dead
was deliberate is clear from the language of those who were chiefly
responsible for the change. Bishops Ridley and Latimer, the
two most conspicuous champions of &ldquo;the new religion,&rdquo; denounced
&ldquo;the Mass&rdquo; with unmeasured violence; Latimer said of
&ldquo;Mistress Missa&rdquo; that &ldquo;the devil hath brought her in again&rdquo;;
Ridley said: &ldquo;I do not take the Mass as it is at this day for the
communion of the Church, but for a popish device,&rdquo; &amp;c. (<i>Works</i>,
ed. Parker Soc., pp. 121, 120), and again: &ldquo;In the stead of the
Lord&rsquo;s holy table they give the people, with much solemn disguising,
a thing which they call their mass; but in deed and
in truth it is a very masking and mockery of the true Supper of
the Lord, or rather I may call it a crafty juggling, whereby these
false thieves and jugglers have bewitched the minds of the
simple people ... unto pernicious idolatory&rdquo; (ib. p. 409). This
language is reflected in the 31st of the Articles of Religion of the
Church of England: &ldquo;Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in
which it was commonly said that the Priest did offer Christ
for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain and guilt,
were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits.&rdquo; Clearly the
word Mass had ceased to be a colourless term generally applicable
to the eucharistic service; it was, in fact, not only proscribed
officially, but in the common language of English people it passed
entirely out of use except in the sense in which it is defined in
Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary, <i>i.e.</i> that of the &ldquo;Service of the Romish
Church at the celebration of the Eucharist.&rdquo; In connexion with
the Catholic reaction in the Church of England, which had its
origin in the &ldquo;Oxford Movement&rdquo; of the 19th century, efforts
have been made by some of the clergy to reintroduce the term
&ldquo;Mass&rdquo; for the Holy Communion in the English Church.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mass, in Music:</span> 1. <i>Polyphonic Masses.</i>&mdash;The composition
of musical settings of the Mass plays a part in the history of
music which is of special importance up to and including the
16th century. As an art-form the musical Mass is governed to a
peculiar degree by the structure of its text. It so happens that
the supremely important parts of the Mass are those which have
the smallest number of words, namely the <i>Kyrie</i>, important as
being the opening prayer; the <i>Sanctus</i> and <i>Benedictus</i>, embodying
the central acts and ideas of the service; and the <i>Agnus Dei</i>,
the prayer with which it concludes. The 16th-century methods
were specially fitted for highly developed music when words
were few and embodied ideas of such important emotional
significance or finality that they could be constantly repeated
without losing force. Now the texts of the <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Credo</i>
were more voluminous than any others which 16th-century
composers attempted to handle in a continuous scheme. The
practical limits of the church service made it impossible to break
them up by setting each clause to a separate movement, a method
by which 16th-century music composers contrived to set psalms
and other long texts to compositions lasting an hour or longer.
Accordingly, Palestrina and his great contemporaries and predecessors
treated the <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Credo</i> in a style midway in
polyphonic organization and rhythmic breadth between that of
the elaborate motet (adopted in the <i>Sanctus</i>) and the homophonic
reciting style of the Litany. The various ways in which this
special style could be modified by the scale of the work, and contrasted
with the broader and more elaborate parts, gave the Mass
(even in its merely technical aspects) a range which made it to the
16th-century composer what the symphony is to the great instrumental
classics. Moreover, as being inseparably associated with
the highest act of worship, it inspired composers in direct proportion
to their piety and depth of mind. Of course there were many
false methods of attacking the art-problem, and many other relationships,
true and false, between the complexity of the settings
of the various parts of the Mass and of motets. The story of the
action of the council of Trent on the subject of corruption of
church music is told elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Music</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palestrina</a></span>);
and it has been recently paralleled by a decree of Pope Pius X.,
which has restored the 16th-century polyphonic Mass to a permanent
place in the Roman Catholic Church music.</p>

<p>2. <i>Instrumental Masses in the Neapolitan Form.</i>&mdash;The next
definite stage in the musical history of the Mass was attained
by the Neapolitan composers who were first to reach musical
coherence after the monodic revolution at the beginning of the
17th century. The fruit of their efforts came to maturity in the
Masses of Mozart and Haydn. By this time the resources of
music were such that the long and varied text of the <i>Gloria</i> and
<i>Credo</i> inevitably either overbalanced the scheme or met with an
obviously perfunctory treatment. It is almost impossible,
without asceticism of a radically inartistic kind, to treat with
the resources of instrumental music and free harmony such
passages as that from the <i>Crucifixus</i> to the <i>Resurrexit</i>, without
an emotional contrast which inevitably throws any natural
treatment of the <i>Sanctus</i> into the background, and makes the
<i>Agnus Dei</i> an inadequate conclusion to the musical scheme. So
unfavourable were the conditions of 18th-century music for the
formation of a good ecclesiastical style that only a very small
proportion of Mozart&rsquo;s and Haydn&rsquo;s Mass music may be said
to represent their ideas of religious music at all. The best features
of their Masses are those that combine faithfulness to the
Neapolitan forms with a contrapuntal richness such as no Neapolitan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page850" id="page850"></a>850</span>
composer ever achieved. Thus Mozart&rsquo;s most perfect as well
as most ecclesiastical example is his extremely terse Mass in F,
written at the age of seventeen, which is scored simply for four-part
chorus and solo voices accompanied by the organ with a
largely independent bass and by two violins mostly in independent
real parts. This scheme, with the addition of a pair of
trumpets and drums and, occasionally, oboes, forms the normal
orchestra of 18th-century Masses developed or degenerated from
this model. Trombones often played with the three lower
voices, a practice of high antiquity surviving from a time when
there were soprano trombones or <i>cornetti</i> (<i>Zincken</i>, a sort of
treble <i>serpent</i>) to play with the sopranos.</p>

<p>3. <i>Symphonic Masses.</i>&mdash;The enormous dramatic development
in the symphonic music of Beethoven made the problem of the
Mass with orchestral accompaniment almost insoluble. This
makes it all the more remarkable that Beethoven&rsquo;s second and
only important Mass (in D, <i>Op.</i> 123) is not only the most
dramatic ever penned but is, perhaps, the last classical Mass that
is thoughtfully based upon the liturgy, and is not a mere musical
setting of what happens to be a liturgic text. It was intended
for the installation of Beethoven&rsquo;s friend, the archduke Rudolph,
as archbishop of Olmütz; and, though not ready until two years
after that occasion, it shows the most careful consideration of
the meaning of a church service, no doubt of altogether exceptional
length and pomp, but by no means impossible for its
unique occasion. Immense as was Beethoven&rsquo;s dramatic force,
it was equalled by his power of sublime repose; and he was
accordingly able once more to put the supreme moment of the
music where the service requires it to be, viz. in the <i>Sanctus</i> and
<i>Benedictus</i>. In the <i>Agnus Dei</i> the circumstances of the time
gave him something special to say which has never so imperatively
demanded utterance since. Europe had been shattered
by the Napoleonic wars. Beethoven read the final prayer of
the Mass as a &ldquo;prayer for inward and outward peace,&rdquo; and,
giving it that title, organized it on the basis of a contrast between
terrible martial sounds and the triumph of peaceful themes, in a
scheme none the less spiritual and sublime because those who
first heard it had derived their notions of the horror of war from
living in Vienna during its bombardment. Critics who have
lived in London during the relief of Mafeking have blamed
Beethoven for his realism.</p>

<p>Schubert&rsquo;s Masses show rather the influence of Beethoven&rsquo;s
not very impressive first Mass, which they easily surpass in
interest, though they rather pathetically show an ignorance of
the meaning of the Latin words. The last two Masses are later
than Beethoven&rsquo;s Mass in D and contain many remarkable
passages. It is evident from them that a dramatic treatment of
the <i>Agnus Dei</i> was &ldquo;in the air&rdquo;; all the more so, since Schubert
does not imitate Beethoven&rsquo;s realism.</p>

<p>4. <i>Lutheran Masses.</i>&mdash;Music with Latin words is not excluded
from the Lutheran Church, and the <i>Kyrie</i> and <i>Gloria</i> are frequently
sung in succession and entitled a Mass. Thus the <i>Four
Short Masses</i> of Bach are called short, not because they are on a
small scale, which is far from being the case, but because they
consist only of the <i>Kyrie</i> and <i>Gloria</i>. Bach&rsquo;s method is to treat
each clause of his text as a separate movement, alternating
choruses with groups of arias; a method which was independently
adopted by Mozart in those larger masses in which he
transcends the Neapolitan type, such as the great unfinished Mass
in C minor. This method, in the case of an entire Mass, results in
a length far too great for a Roman Catholic service; and Bach&rsquo;s
B minor Mass, which is such a setting of the entire test, must be
regarded as a kind of oratorio. It thus has obviously nothing
to do with the Roman liturgy; but as an independent setting
of the text it is one of the most sublime and profoundly religious
works in all art; and its singular perfection as a design is
nowhere more evident than in its numerous adaptations of
earlier works.</p>

<p>The most interesting of all these adaptations is the setting
of the words: &ldquo;Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum et vitam
venturi saeculi.&mdash;<span class="sc">Amen.</span>&rdquo; Obviously the greatest difficulty in
any elaborate instrumental setting of the <i>Credo</i> is the inevitable
anti-climax after the <i>Resurrexit</i>. Bach contrives to give this
anti-climax a definite artistic value; all the more from the fact
that his <i>Crucifixus</i> and <i>Resurrexit</i>, and the contrast between
them, are among the most sublime and directly impressive things
in all music. To the end of his <i>Resurrexit</i> chorus he appends
an orchestral <i>ritornello</i>, summing up the material of the chorus
in the most formal possible way, and thereby utterly destroying
all sense of finality as a member of a large group, while at the
same time not in the least impairing the force and contrast of
the whole&mdash;that contrast having ineffaceably asserted itself at
the moment when it occurred. After this the aria &ldquo;Et in
spiritum sanctum,&rdquo; in which the next dogmatic clauses are
enshrined like relics in a casket, furnishes a beautiful decorative
design on which the listener can repose his mind; and then comes
the voluminous ecclesiastical fugue, <i>Confiteor unum baptisma</i>,
leading, as through the door and world-wide spaces of the Catholic
Church, to that veil which is not all darkness to the eye of
faith. At the words &ldquo;Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum&rdquo;
the music plunges suddenly into a slow series of some of the most
sublime and mysterious modulations ever written, until it breaks
out as suddenly into a <i>vivace e allegro</i> of broad but terse design,
which comes to its climax very rapidly and ends as abruptly as
possible, the last chord being carefully written as a short note
without a pause. This gives the utmost possible effect of finality
to the whole <i>Credo</i>, and contrasts admirably with the coldly
formal instrumental end of the <i>Resurrexit</i> three movements
further back. Now, such subtleties seem as if they must be unconscious
on the part of the composer; yet here Bach is so far
aware of his reasons that his <i>vivace e allegro</i> is an arrangement
of the second chorus of a church cantata, <i>Gott man lobet dich in
der Stille</i>; and in the cantata the chorus has introductory and
final symphonies and a middle section with a <i>da capo!</i></p>

<p>5. <i>The Requiem.</i>&mdash;The <i>Missa pro defunctis</i> or <i>Requiem Mass</i>
has a far less definite musical history than the ordinary Mass;
and such special musical forms as it has produced have little in
common with each other. The text of the <i>Dies Irae</i> so imperatively
demands either a very dramatic elaboration or none at all,
that even in the 16th century it could not possibly be set to
continuous music on the lines of the <i>Gloria</i> and <i>Credo</i>. Fortunately,
however, the Gregorian <i>canto fermo</i> associated with it is
of exceptional beauty and symmetry; and the great 16th century
masters either, like Palestrina, left it to be sung as plain-chant,
or obviated all occasion for dramatic expression by setting it in
versicles (like their settings of the <i>Magnificat</i> and other canticles)
for two groups of voices alternatively, or for the choir in
alternation with the plain chant of the priests.</p>

<p>With modern orchestral conditions the text seems positively
to demand an unecclesiastical, not to say sensational, style, and
probably the only instrumental Requiem Masses which can be
said to be great church music are the sublime unfinished work of
Mozart (the antecedents of which would be a very interesting
subject) and the two beautiful works by Cherubini. These latter,
however, tend to be funereal rather than uplifting. The only other
artistic solution of the problem is to follow Berlioz, Verdi and
Dvo&#345;ák in the complete renunciation of all ecclesiastical style.</p>

<p>Brahms&rsquo;s <i>Deutsches requiem</i> has nothing to do with the Mass
for the dead, being simply a large choral work on a text compiled
from the Bible by the composer.</p>

<p>With the exception of this corner, Massachusetts is a part of the
slanting upland that includes all of southern New England. This
upland is an uplifted peneplain of subaerial denudation,<a name="fa2r" id="fa2r" href="#ft2r"><span class="sp">2</span></a> now so
far advanced in a &ldquo;second&rdquo; cycle of weathering and so thoroughly
dissected that to an untrained eye it appears to be only a country
of hills confusedly arranged. The general contour of the upland,
marked by a remarkably even sky-line, is evident at almost every
locality in the state. In the nature and position of the upland
rocks&mdash;mainly crystalline schists and gneisses, excessively complicated
and disordered in mass, and also internally deformed&mdash;there
is found abundant proof that the peneplain is a degraded mountain
region. The upland is interrupted by the rivers, and on the coast
by great lowlands, and is everywhere marked by hills somewhat surmounting
the generally even skyline. Monadnock (in New Hampshire,
near N.E. Massachusetts), the Blue Hills near Boston, Greylock,
in the north-west, and Wachusett in the centre, are the most commanding
remnant-summits (known generically as &ldquo;Monadnocks&rdquo;)
of the original mountain system. But in the derivant valley
peneplains developed in the present cycle of denudation, and there
are residual summits also; in the Connecticut Valley trap ridges,
of which Mt Tom and Mt Holyoke are the best examples; at
Mt Holyoke, lava necks; occasionally in the lowlands, ridges of
resistant sandstone, like Deerfield Mountain near Northampton;
in the Berkshire Valley, summits of resistant schists, like Greylock,
the highest summit in the state. The larger streams have cut
their channels to very moderate gradients, but the smaller ones
are steeper. The Housatonic and Millers (and the Connecticut
also, but not in its course within Massachusetts alone) afford beautiful
examples of the dependence of valley breadth upon the strike
of soft or harder rocks across the stream. The Connecticut lowland
is cut from 5 to 18 m. wide in soft sandstones and shales. The
glacial era has left abundant evidences in the topography of
the state. The ice covered even the Monadnocks. Till drumlins,
notably abundant on the lowland about Boston and the highland
near Spencer; morainic hills, extending, <i>e.g.</i> all along Cape Cod;
eskers, kames and river terraces afford the plainest evidences of
the extent of the glacial sheet. The Berkshire country&mdash;Berkshire,
Hampden, Hampshire and Franklin counties&mdash;is among the most
beautiful regions of the United States. It is a rolling highland
dominated by long, wooded hill-ridges, remarkably even-topped in
general elevation, intersected and broken by deep valleys. Scores
of charming lakes lie in the hollows. The district is often called
the Lake Region of America, partly from the comparableness of
its scenic beauties with the English Lake Country (Matthew Arnold,
however, wrote: &ldquo;The country is pleasing but not to be compared
with Westmoreland. It is wider and opener, and neither hills
nor lakes are so effective.&rdquo;), and partly from the parallelism of
literary associations. It has become since 1850, and especially
in much more recent years, a favoured resort of summer residents.
Owing to topography, and also to the manner in which Massachusetts
was settled, the western counties were long connected commercially
more closely with New York than with Massachusetts, and this
territory was long in dispute between these two states.</p>

<p>The Connecticut is the most considerable stream, and is navigable
by small craft. Its valley, much the richest portion of the state
agriculturally, is celebrated for the quiet variety and beauty of
its scenery. The Housatonic, in portions placid, in others wild and
rapid, winding along the deflecting barrier of the Hoosac Hills,
is the most beautiful river of the state, despite the mercantile use
of its water-power. The Merrimac, the second stream of the state
in volume, runs in a charming valley through the extreme north-east
corner, and affords immensely valuable water-power at Lowell,
Lawrence and Haverhill.</p>

<p>South of Cohasset the shore is sandy, with a few isolated rocky
ledges and boulders. About Boston, and to the north of it, the
shore is rocky and picturesque. Cape Cod, like a human arm
doubled at the elbow, 40 m. from shoulder to elbow and 30 from
elbow to hand, is nowhere more than a few miles broad. It is a
sandy ridge, dotted with summer resorts and cottages. Cape Ann
has a rugged interior and a ragged, rocky coast. It, too, is a
summer recreation ground, with much beautiful scenery. Boston
Harbor (originally known as Massachusetts Bay, a name which
now has a much broader signification) is the finest roadstead on
the coast. The extreme hook of the Cape Cod Peninsula forms
Provincetown Harbor, which is an excellent and capacious port
of refuge for vessels approaching Boston. Salem Harbor is the
most considerable other haven on Massachusetts Bay; on Buzzard&rsquo;s
Bay New Bedford has a good harbour, and on the Atlantic coast
are the excellent harbours of Gloucester and Marblehead, both frequented
by summer residents. Gloucester has the largest fishery
interests of any place in the country, and is one of the chief fishing
ports of the world. Buzzard&rsquo;s Bay is also a popular yachting
ground, and all about its shores are towns of summer residence.
Wood&rsquo;s Hole is a station of the United States Bureau of Fisheries,
and a marine biological laboratory is there.</p>

<p>The principal islands lie off the south coast. The largest is
Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, about 20 m. long, with an extreme breadth
of about 9½ m. It has in Vineyard Haven (Holmes&rsquo;s Hole) a
spacious harbour, much frequented by wind-bound vessels seeking
a passage round Cape Cod. The island is covered with stunted
trees. Its population was formerly dependent wholly upon the
sea, but its climate has made it a popular summer resort, Oak
Bluffs being one of the chief resorts of the Atlantic coast. Farther
east, Nantucket, a smaller island of triangular shape, is likewise
the home of a seafaring folk who still retain in some degree primitive
habits, though summer visitors are more and more affecting its
life.</p>

<p><i>Flora and Fauna.</i>&mdash;Massachusetts lies entirely in the humid
area of the Transition life-zone, with the exception of the extreme
north-western corner of the state, which lies in the Boreal zone.
Thus the original native trees and plants were those common to
New England and northern New York. The presence of a dense
population has driven out some, and brought in others, including
some noxious weeds. The larger wild animals have disappeared,
excepting an occasional black bear or deer. Of the smaller fur-bearing
animals, the beaver was long ago exterminated, the otter
is seen very rarely, and the mink only in the most isolated districts;
but foxes, skunks, weasels, musk-rats, rabbits, and grey and red
squirrels are not uncommon. Copperhead snakes and rattlesnakes
arc occasionally seen, and there are several species of harmless
serpents. Of game birds the most characteristic is the partridge
(ruffed grouse), exclusively a woodland bird; the Wilson&rsquo;s snipe
and the woodcock are not uncommon in favourable localities, and
several species of ducks are found especially in the bays and marshes
near the coast during the seasons of migration. A stray eagle is
sometimes seen. Very interesting to ornithologists are the few
heath hens, the eastern representative of the prairie hen (pinnated
grouse), which are found on the island of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, and
are the sole survivors in the eastern states of one of the finest of
American game birds, now practically exterminated even on the
western plains. There are many insectivorous birds; among the
song birds are the hermit thrush, the wood thrush, the Wilson&rsquo;s
thrush, the brown thrasher, the bobolink, the catbird, the oven
bird, the house wren, the song sparrow, the fox sparrow, the vesper
sparrow, the white-throated sparrow (Peabody bird), the gold-finch
and the robin. Brook trout are found, especially in the streams
in the western part of the state, and bass, pickerel, perch and smaller
fish occur in the rivers and other inland waters. Fish are so abundant
on the coast that the cod is sometimes used as an emblem of
the state; thus a figure of one hangs in the representatives&rsquo; chamber
at the State House. The artificial propagation and preservation
of salmon and other edible fresh-water fish have been carried on
successfully under the supervision of a state commission. The
commonwealth has expended large sums since 1890 in a vain attempt
to exterminate the gipsy moth (<i>Ocneria</i>, or more exactly <i>Porthetria,
dispar</i>), accidentally allowed to escape in 1869 by a French
naturalist.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is trying, showing great extremes of temperature
(20° F. below zero to 100° above) and marked local variations.
The south-eastern coast and islands are mildest. The mean average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page852" id="page852"></a>852</span>
temperature of Boston is 48° F. In the interior it is slightly lower.
The mean summer temperature generally over the state is about
70° F. Changes are often sudden, and the passage from winter to
summer is through a rapid spring. The ocean tempers the climate
considerably on the seaboard. Boston Harbor has been frozen over
in the past, but steamtugs plying constantly now prevent the occurrence
of such obstruction. In the elevated region in the west the
winters are decidedly severe, and the springs and summers often
late and cold. Williamstown has a winter mean of about 23° F.
The yearly precipitation is about 39 to 45 in., decreasing inland,
and is evenly distributed throughout the year. Fogs are common
on the coast, and east wind drizzles; the north-east winds being
the weather bane of spring and late autumn. In the summer and
the autumn the weather is commonly fine, and often most beautiful;
and especially in the Berkshires a cool, pure and elastic atmosphere
prevails, relatively dry, and altogether delightful.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The soil, except in some of the valleys, is not
naturally fertile; and sandy wastes are common in the south-east
parts. High cultivation, however, has produced valuable market-gardens
about Boston and the larger towns; and industry has
made tillage remunerative in most other parts. The gross value
of agricultural products is not great compared with that of other
industries, but they are of great importance in the economy of the
state. The total value of farm property in 1900 was $182,646,704,
including livestock valued at $15,798,464. Of the increase in
the total value of farm property between 1850 and 1900 more than
half was in the decade 1890-1900; this increase being due partly
to the rising value of suburban realty, but also to a development
of intensive farming that has been very marked since 1880. The
total value of farm products in 1899 was $42,298,274 (expenditure
for fertilizers $1,320,600); crops representing 54.7 and animal
products 45.3% of this total. The leading crops and their percentages
of the total crop value were hay and forage (39.1%),
vegetables (23.9%), fruits and nuts (11.7%), forest products
(8.4%), and flowers and plants (7.1%). Of the animal products
67.3% were dairy products, and 20.8% poultry and eggs. Cereals<a name="fa3r" id="fa3r" href="#ft3r"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
have been for many years declining, although Indian corn is a
valuable subsidiary to the dairy interest, which is the most thriving
farm industry. The value of farms on which dairying was the
chief source of income in 1900 was 46% of the total farm value of
the state; the corresponding percentages for livestock, vegetables,
hay and grain, flowers and plants, fruit and tobacco, being respectively
14.6, 10.2, 8.0, 4.2, 3.2, and 1.8%. The shrinkage of cereal
crops has been mainly responsible for the idea that Massachusetts
is agriculturally decadent. Parallel to this shrinkage was the
decrease in ranging sheep (82.0% from 1850-1900; 34.2% from
1890-1900), and cattle, once numerous in the hill counties of the
west, and in the Connecticut Valley; Boston, then ranking after
London as the second wool market of the world, and being at
one time the chief packing centre of the country. Dairy cows increased,
however, from 1850 to 1900 by 41.9% (1890-1900, 7.3%).
The amount of improved farmland decreased in the same period
39.4%, decreasing even more since 1880 than earlier, and amounting
in 1900 to no more than 25.1% of the area of the state; but
this decrease has been compensated by increased value of products,
especially since the beginning of intensive agriculture. An unusual
density of urban settlement, furnishing excellent home markets
and transportation facilities, are the main props of this new interest.
Worcester and Middlesex counties are agriculturally foremost.
Tobacco, which has been cultivated since colonial times, especially
since the Civil War, is grown exclusively in the Connecticut Valley
or on its borders. In the swamps and bogs of the south-east coast
cranberry culture is practised, this district producing in 1900
three-fifths of the entire yield of the United States. &ldquo;Abandoned
farms&rdquo; (aggregating, in 1890, 3.4% of the total farm area, and
6.85% in Hampshire county) are common, especially in the west
and south-east.</p>

<p><i>Mines and Mining.</i>&mdash;Granite is the chief mineral, and granite
quarrying is the principal mineral industry of the state. In 1900
the value of manufactures based primarily upon the products of
mines and quarries was $196,930,979, or 19% of the state&rsquo;s total
manufactured product. In 1906 Massachusetts led all states in
the value of its granite output, but in 1907 and 1908 it was second to
Vermont. The value of the product (including a small output
of igneous rocks) was in 1903, $2,351,027; 1904, $2,554,748; 1905,
$2,251,319; 1906, $3,327,416; 1907, $2,328,777; 1908, $2,027,463.</p>

<p>Granite boulders were used for construction in Massachusetts
as early as 1650. Systematic quarrying of siliceous crystalline
rocks in New England began at Quincy in about 1820. The
Gloucester quarries, opened in 1824, were probably the next to be
worked regularly. The principal granite quarries are in Milford,
(Worcester county), Quincy and Milton (Norfolk county), Rockport
(Essex county) and Becket (Berkshire county). Of the fourteen
quarries of &ldquo;Milford granite,&rdquo; twelve are in the township of that
name, and two in Hopkinton township, Middlesex county. B. K.
Emerson and J. H. Perry classify this granite as post-Cambrian.
They describe it<a name="fa4r" id="fa4r" href="#ft4r"><span class="sp">4</span></a> as &ldquo;a compact, massive rock, somewhat above
medium grain, and of light colour. The light flesh colour of the
feldspar, and the blue of the quartz give it in some places a slight
pinkish tint, and it is now much used as a building-stone under
the name of &lsquo;pink granite.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Quincy granite district lies around the north-east end of the
Blue Hill region, about 11 m. south of Boston. For monumental
purposes this granite is classified as &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; &ldquo;dark,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;extra dark.&rdquo; Quincy granite takes a very high polish, owing to
the absence of mica and to the coarser cleavage of its hornblende
and augite. The lightest of the monumental stone quarried at
Quincy is called gold-leaf; it is bluish-green gray, speckled with
black and light yellow brown. Another variety has small, rather
widely separated cherry-red dots.</p>

<p>The Rockport granite is found along or near the seashore, between
Rockport and Bay View, and within about three-quarters of a mile of
Cape Ann. The granite is of two kinds, known commercially as
&ldquo;grey granite&rdquo; and &ldquo;green granite.&rdquo; Both varieties are hard and
take a very high polish.</p>

<p>The Becker granite (known as &ldquo;Chester dark&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chester
light&rdquo;) is a muscovite-biotite granite varying from medium grey
to medium bluish grey colour, and fine in texture. It is used
principally for monuments.</p>

<p>In 1907 Massachusetts ranked sixth among the states in the
value of its trap rock product ($432,604), and eighth in sandstone
($243,328). The value of the marble produced in the same year
was $212,438, the state ranking fifth in the value of the total
product and fourth in building-marble. Other minerals are
emery, limestone and quartz. The state ranked fifth in 1906 in
the total value of stone quarried ($4,333,616), and eighth in 1908
($2,955,195). The output of lime in 1908 was 107,813 tons, valued
at $566,022. Second in value to the various stones were the clay
products of the state, which were valued in 1906 at $2,172,733
(of which $1,415,864 was the value of common brick) and in 1908
at $1,647,362 (of which $950,921 was the value of common brick).
There are many mineral springs in the state, more than half being
in Essex and Middlesex counties. The total amount of mineral
waters sold in 1908 was valued at $227,907. In that year the total
value of the minerals and mining products of the state was
$5,925,949. Gold has been found in small quantities in Middlesex,
Norfolk and Plymouth counties.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures.</i>&mdash;Though only four states of the Union are smaller,
only three exceeded Massachusetts in 1905 in the value of manufactured
products (six exceeding it in population); and this despite very
scant native resources of raw materials and a very limited home
market. Historical priority of development, exceptionally extensive
and well utilized water-power, and good transportation facilities are
largely responsible for the exceptional rank of Massachusetts as
a manufacturing state. Vast water-power is developed on the
Merrimac at Lawrence and Lowell, and on the Connecticut at
South Hadley, and to a less extent at scores of other cities on
many streams and artificial ponds; many of the machines that
have revolutionized industrial conditions since the beginning of
the factory system have been invented by Massachusetts men;
and the state contains various technical schools of great importance.
In 1900 the value of manufactures was $1,035,198,989, an
increase from 1890 of 16.6%; that from 1880 to 1890 having been
40.7%. In textiles&mdash;cottons, worsteds, woollens and carpets&mdash;in
boots and shoes, in rubber foot-wear, in fine writing paper, and
in other minor products, it is the leading state of the country.
The textile industries (the making of carpets and rugs, cotton goods,
cotton smallwares, dyeing and finishing textiles, felt goods, felt
hats, hosiery and knit goods, shoddy, silk and silk goods, woollen
goods, and worsted goods), employed 32.5% of all manufacturing
wage earners in 1905, and their product ($271,369,816) was 24.1%
of the total, and of this nearly one-half ($129,171,449) was in cotton
goods, being 28.9% of the total output of the country, as compared
with 11% for South Carolina, the nearest competitor of Massachusetts.
There is a steadily increasing product of fine grade fabrics.
The output of worsted goods in 1905 ($51,973,944) was more than
three-tenths that of the entire country, Rhode Island being second
with $44,477,596; in Massachusetts the increase in the value of
this product was 28.2% between 1900 and 1905. The value of
woollen goods in 1905 ($44,653,940) was more than three-tenths
of the entire product for the country; and it was 44.6% more than
that of 1900. The value of boots and shoes and cut stock in 1905
was $173,612,660, being 23% greater than in 1900; the value of
boots and shoes in 1905 ($144,291,426) was 45.1% of the country&rsquo;s
output, that of New York, the second state, being only 10.7%.
In this industry, as in the manufacture of cotton goods, Massachusetts
has long been without serious rivalry; Brockton, Lynn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page853" id="page853"></a>853</span>
Haverhill, Marlboro and Boston, in the order named, being the
principal centres. The third industry in 1905 was that of foundry
and machine-shop products ($58,508,793), of which Boston and
Worcester are the principal centres. Lesser interests, in the order
of importance, with the product value of each in 1905, were:
rubber goods ($53,133,020), tanned, curried and finished leather
($33,352,999), in the manufacture of which Massachusetts ranked
second among the states; paper and wood pulp<a name="fa5r" id="fa5r" href="#ft5r"><span class="sp">5</span></a> ($32,012,247),
in the production of which the state ranked second among the
states of the Union; slaughtering and meat packing ($30,253,838);
printing and publishing ($33,900,748, of which $21,020,237 was
the value of newspapers and periodicals); clothing ($21,724,056);
electrical machinery, apparatus and supplies ($15,882,216); lumber
($12,636,329); iron and steel, steel works and rolling-mills products
($11,947,731; less than in 1900); cordage and twine ($11,173,521),
in the manufacture of which Massachusetts was second only to
New York; furniture ($11,092,581); malt liquors ($11,080,944);
jewelry ($10,073,595), Massachusetts ranking second to Rhode
Island; confectionery ($9,317,996), in which Massachusetts was third
among the states.</p>

<p class="pt2">Many of these industries have a history going back far into colonial
times, some even dating from the first half of the 17th century.
Textile products were really varied and of considerable importance
before 1700. The policy of the British government towards such
industries in the colonial period was in general repressive. The
non-importation sentiment preceding the War of Independence
fostered home manufactures considerably, and the Embargo and
Non-Intercourse Acts before the war of 1812, as well as that war
itself (despite the subsequent glut of British goods) had a much
greater effect; for they mark the introduction of the factory system,
which by 1830 was firmly established in the textile industry and
was rapidly transforming other industries. Improvements were
introduced much more slowly than in England, the cost of cotton
machinery as late as 1826 being 50-60% greater in America. The
first successful power loom in America was set up at Waltham in
1814. Carding, roving and spinning machines were constructed
at Bridgewater in 1786. The first cotton mill had been established
in Beverly in 1788, and the first real woollen factory at Byfield
in 1794. Woolcard machinery destined to revolutionize the industry
was devised by Amos Whittemore (1759-1828) in 1797;
spinning jennies were in operation under water-power before 1815.
Carpet-weaving was begun at Worcester in 1804. &ldquo;Not a yard
of fancy wool fabric had ever been woven by the power-loom in
any country till done by William Crompton at the Middlesex Mills,
Lowell, in 1840&rdquo; (Samuel Lawrence).<a name="fa6r" id="fa6r" href="#ft6r"><span class="sp">6</span></a> The introduction of the
remarkably complete machinery of the shoe industry was practically
complete by 1865, this being the last of the great industries to come
under the full dominance of machinery. At Pittsfield and at
Dalton is centred the manufacture of fine writing papers, including
that of paper used by the national government for bonds and
paper money. Four-fifths of all loft-dried paper produced in the
country from 1860-1897 was made within 15 m. of Springfield;
Holyoke and South Hadley being the greatest producers. Vulcanized
rubber is a Massachusetts invention. Most of the imitation
jewelry of the United States is produced at Attleboro and North
Attleboro, and in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1905 Boston
produced 16.4% of all the manufactures of the state, and Lynn,
the second city, which had been fifth in 1900, 4.9%. Some
industries which have since become dead or of relatively slight
magnitude were once of much greater significance, economically or
socially: such as the rum-distilling connected with the colonial
slave trade, and various interests concerned with shipbuilding and
navigation. The packing of pork and beef formerly centred in
Boston; but, while the volume of this business has not diminished,
it has been greatly exceeded in the west. For many years Massachusetts
controlled a vast lumber trade, drawing upon the forests
of Maine, but the growth of the west changed the old channels
of trade, and Boston carpenters came to make use of western
timber. It was between 1840 and 1850 that the cotton manufactures
of Massachusetts began to assume large proportions; and
about the same time the manufacture of boots and shoes centred
there. Medford ships began to be famous shortly after the beginning
of the 19th century, and by 1845 that town employed one quarter
of all the shipwrights in the state.</p>

<p>Fishing is an important industry. Drift whales were utilized
in the earliest years of the colony, and shore boating for the baleen
(or &ldquo;right&rdquo;) whale&mdash;rich in bone and in blubber yielding common
oil&mdash;was an industry already regulated by various towns before
1650; but the pursuit of the sperm whale did not begin until about
1713. The former industry had died out before the War of Independence;
the latter is not yet quite extinct. Nantucket and
New Bedford were the centres of the whaling trade, which, for the
energy and skill required and the length (three to five years when
sailing vessels were employed) of the ever-widening voyages which
finally took the fishermen into every quarter of the globe, contributes
the most romantic chapters in the history of American
commerce. At one time it gave occupation to a thousand ships,
but the introduction of petroleum gradually diminished this resource
of the lesser ports. The Newfoundland Bank fisheries were of
greater economic importance and are still very important. Gloucester
is the chief centre of the trade. The value of fishery products
in 1895 was $5,703,143, and in 1905 $7,025,249; and 15,694 persons
were engaged in the fisheries. Though cod is much the most
important fish (in 1905 fresh cod were valued at $991,679, and
salted cod at $696,928), haddock (fresh, $1,051,910; salted, $17,194),
mackerel (value in 1905, including horse mackerel, $970,876),
herring (fresh, $266,699; salted, $114,997), pollock ($267,927),
hake ($258,438), halibut ($218,232), and many other varieties are
taken in great quantities. The shell fisheries are less important
than those of Maine.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;Already by 1660 New England products were an
&ldquo;important element in the commerce and industries of the mother
country&rdquo; (Weeden). Codfish was perhaps the truest basis of her
commerce, which soon came to include the West Indies, Africa and
southern Europe. Of fundamental importance was the trade with
the French West Indies, licit and illicit, particularly after the Peace
of Utrecht (1713). Provisions taken to Newfoundland, poor fish
to the West Indies, molasses to New England, rum to Africa and
good cod to France and Spain, were the commonest ventures of
foreign trade. The English Navigation Acts were generally evaded,
and were economically of little effect; politically they were of great
importance in Massachusetts as a force that worked for independence.
Privateering, piracy and slave-trading&mdash;which though of
less extent than in Rhode Island became early of importance, and
declined but little before the American War of Independence&mdash;give
colour to the history of colonial trade.</p>

<p>Trade with China and India from Salem was begun in 1785 (first
voyage from New York, 1784), and was first controlled there, and
afterwards in Boston till the trade was lost to New York. The
Boston trade to the Canadian north-west coast was begun in 1788.
The first regular steamship line from Boston to other American
Atlantic ports was established in 1824. In commercial relations the
chief port of Massachusetts attained its greatest importance about
1840, when it was selected as the American terminus of the first
steamship line (Cunard) connecting Great Britain with the United
States; but Boston lost the commercial prestige then won by the
failure of the state to promote railway communication with the west,
so as to equal the development effected by other cities. The decline
of commerce, however, had already begun, manufacturing supplanting
it in importance; and this decline was rapid by 1850. From
1840 to 1860 Massachusetts-built ships competed successfully in the
carrying trade of the world. Before 1840 a ship of 500 tons was
a large ship, but after the discovery of gold in California the size
of vessels increased rapidly and their lines were more and more
adapted to speed. The limit of size was reached in an immense
clipper of 4555 tons, and the greatest speed was attained in a passage
from San Francisco to Boston in seventy-five days, and from San
Francisco to Cork in ninety-three days. The development of steam
navigation for the carrying of large cargoes has driven this fleet
from the sea. Only a small part of the exports and imports of
Massachusetts is now carried in American bottoms.<a name="fa7r" id="fa7r" href="#ft7r"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The first
grain elevator built in Boston, and one of the first in the world, was
erected in 1843, when Massachusetts sent Indian corn to Ireland.
When the Civil War and steam navigation put an end to the supremacy
of Massachusetts wooden sailing ships, much of the capital
which had been employed in navigation was turned into developing
railway facilities and coasting steamship lines. In 1872 the great
fire in Boston made large drains upon the capital of the state, and
several years of depression followed. But in 1907 Boston was the
second port of the United States in the magnitude of its foreign
commerce. In that year the value of imports at the Boston-Charlestown
customs district was $123,411,168, and the value of exports was
$104,610,908; for 1909 the corresponding figures were $127,025,654
and $72,936,869. Other ports of entry in the state in 1909
were Newburyport, Gloucester, Salem, Marblehead, Plymouth,
Barnstable, Nantucket, Edgartown, New Bedford and Fall River.
A protective tariff was imposed in early colonial times and protection
was generally approved in the state until toward the close of
the 19th century, when a strong demand became apparent for
reciprocity with Canada and for tariff reductions on the raw materials
(notably hides) of Massachusetts manufactures.</p>

<p>At the end of 1908 the length of railway lines within the state
was 2,109.33 miles. The Hoosac Tunnel, 5¾ m. long, pierces the
Hoosac Mountain in the north-west corner of the state, affording
a communication with western lines. It cost about $20,000,000,
the state lending its credit, and was built between 1855 and 1874.
The inter-urban electric railways are of very great importance in
the state; in 1908 the total mileage of street and inter-urban electric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page854" id="page854"></a>854</span>
railways was 2841.59 m. (2233.85 m. being first main track). The
Cape Cod canal, 12 m. long, from Sandwich on Barnstable Bay to
Buzzard&rsquo;s Bay, was begun in June 1909, with a view to shortening
the distance by water from Boston to New York and eliminating the
danger of the voyage round Cape Cod.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population of the state in 1910 was
3,366,416, the increases in successive decades after 1790 being
respectively 11.6, 11.6, 11.9, 16.6, 20.9, 34.8, 23.8, 18.4, 22.4,
25.6, 25.3 and 20%.<a name="fa8r" id="fa8r" href="#ft8r"><span class="sp">8</span></a> With the exception of Rhode Island, it is
the most densely populated state in the Union, the average
number to the square mile in 1900 being 349 (in 1910, 418.8), and
the urban population, <i>i.e.</i> the population of places having above
8000 or more inhabitants, being 69.9% in 1890 and in 1900
76.0% of the total population (in places above 2500, 91.5%;
in places above 25,000, 58.3%). The female population is
greater (and has been since 1765, at least) than the male, the
percentage being in 1900 greater than in any other state of the
Union (51.3%; District of Columbia, owing to clerks in government
service 52.6%). In 1900 less than 1.3% of the population
was coloured; 30.2% were foreign-born (this element
having almost continuously risen from 16.49% in 1855),
and 62.3% of all inhabitants and 46.5% of those native-born
had one or both parents of foreign birth. Ireland contributed
the largest proportion of the foreign-born (29.5%),
although since 1875 the proportion of Irish in the total population
has considerably fallen. After the Irish the leading foreign
elements are Canadian English (18.7%), Canadian French
(15.8%) and English (9.7%), these four constituting three-fourths
of the foreign population. Since 1885 the natives of
southern Italy have greatly increased in number. Of the increase
in total population from 1856-1895 only a third could be attributed
to the excess of births over deaths; two-thirds being due
to immigration from other states or from abroad. Boston is the
second immigrant port of the country. A large part of the transatlantic
immigrants pass speedily to permanent homes in the west,
but by far the greater part of the Canadian influx remains.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>According to the census of 1910 there were 32 incorporated cities<a name="fa9r" id="fa9r" href="#ft9r"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
in Massachusetts, of which 6 had between 12,000 and 20,000 inhabitants;
3 between 20,000 and 25,000 (Gloucester, Medford and
North Adams); 11 between 25,000 and 50,000 (Maiden, Haverhill,
Salem, Newton, Fitchburg, Taunton, Everett, Quincy, Pittsfield,
Waltham, Chicopee); 7 between 50,000 and 100,000 (New Bedford,
Lynn, Springfield, Lawrence, Somerville, Holyoke, Brockton); and
5 more than 100,000 (Boston, 670,585; Worcester, 145,986; Fall
River, 119,295; Lowell, 106,294; Cambridge, 104,839).</p>

<p>Taking quinquennial periods from 1856-1905 the birth-rates were
29.5, 25.3, 26.0, 27.6, 24.2, 25.0, 25.8, 27.6, 27.0 and 24.2 per 1,000;
and the death-rates 17.7, 20.7, 18.2, 20.8, 18.8, 19.8, 19.4, 19.8, 18.0 and
16.4.<a name="fa10r" id="fa10r" href="#ft10r"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Pneumonia and consumption, approximately of equal fatality
(15 to 18 per 10,000 each), exceed more than twofold the diseases
of next lower fatality, cancer and cholera infantum.</p>

<p>Of males (1,097,581) engaged in 1900 in gainful occupations 47.1%
were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits (77.9 in
every 100 in 1870 and 73 in 1900), 27.1 in trade and transportation,
14.2 in domestic and personal service, 7.4 in agricultural pursuits
and 4.2 in professional service. The corresponding percentages for
females (1,169,467) were 46.4 in manufacturing (in 1890, 52%),
32.3 in domestic and personal service, 13.6 in trade and transportation,
7.1 in professional service and 0.6 in agriculture. Formerly
farmers&rsquo; daughters of native stock were much employed in factories;
but since operatives of foreign birth or parentage have in great part
taken their places, they have sought other occupations, largely in the
manufacture of small wares in the cities, and particularly in departments
of trade where skilled labour is essential. Household service
is seldom now done, as it formerly was, by women of native stock.
The federal census of 1900 showed that of every 100 persons employed
for gain only 37.5% were of native descent (that is, had a native-born
father). Natives heavily predominated in agriculture and the
professions, slightly in trade, and held barely more than half of all
governmental positions; but in transportation, personal service,
manufactures, labour and domestic service, the predominance of
the foreign element warranted the assertion of the state Bureau
of Statistics of Labour that &ldquo;the strong industrial condition of
Massachusetts has been secured and is held not by the labour of
what is called the &lsquo;native stock,&rsquo; but by that of the immigrants.&rdquo;
After the original and exclusively English immigration from 1620 to
1640 there was nothing like regular foreign immigration until the
19th century; and it was a favourite assertion of Dr Palfrey that
the blood of the fishing folk on Cape Cod was more purely English
through two centuries than that of the inhabitants of any English
county.</p>

<p>With foreign immigration the strength of the Roman Catholic
Church has greatly increased: in 1906 of every 1000 of estimated
population 355 were members of the Roman Catholic Church (a
proportion exceeded only in New Mexico and in Rhode Island; 310
was the number per 1000 in Louisiana), and only 148 were communicants
of Protestant bodies; in 1906 there were 1,080,706
Roman Catholics (out of a total of 1,562,621 communicants of all
denominations), 119,196 Congregationalists, 80,894 Baptists, 65,498
Methodists and 51,636 Protestant Episcopalians.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to &ldquo;abandoned farms&rdquo; in Massachusetts.
The desertion of farms was an inevitable result of the opening of
the great cereal regions of the west, but it is by no means characteristic
of Massachusetts alone. The Berkshire district affords an
excellent example of the interrelations of topography, soil and
population. Many hill towns once thriving have long since become
abandoned, desolate and comparatively inaccessible; though with
the development of the summer resident&rsquo;s interests many will
probably eventually regain prosperity. Almost half of the highland
towns reached their maximum population before the opening
of the 19th century, although Berkshire was scarcely settled till after
1760, and three-fourths of them before 1850. On the other hand
three-fourths of the lowland towns reached their maximum since
that date, and half of them since 1880. The lowland population
increased six and a half times in the century, the upland diminished
by an eighth. Socially and educationally the upland has furnished
an interesting example of decadence. Since 1865 (at least) various
parts of Cape Cod have shrunk greatly in population, agriculture
and manufactures, and even in fishing interests; this reconstruction
of industrial and social interests being, apparently, simply part of
the general urban movement&mdash;a movement toward better opportunities.
What prosperity or stability remains in various Cape Cod
communities is largely due to foreign immigrants&mdash;especially British-Americans
and Portuguese from the Azores; although the population
remains, to a degree exceptional in northern states, of native
stock.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;Representative government goes back to 1634,
and the bicameral legislature to 1644. The constitution of 1780,
which still endures (the only remaining state constitution of the
18th century), was framed in the main by Samuel Adams, and as
an embodiment of colonial experience and revolutionary principles,
and as a model of constitution-making in the early years
of independence, is of very great historical interest. It has been
amended with considerable freedom (37 amendments up to 1907),
but with more conservatism than has often prevailed in the constitutional
reform of other states; so that the constitution of
Massachusetts is not so completely in harmony with modern
democratic sentiment as are the public opinion and statute law
of the state. The commonwealth, for example, is still denominated
&ldquo;sovereign,&rdquo; and education is not declared a constitutional
duty of the commonwealth. One unique feature is the duty of
the supreme court to give legal advice, on request, to the governor
and council. Another almost equally exceptional feature is the
persistence of the colonial executive council, consisting of members
chosen to represent divisions of the state, who assist the
governor in his executive functions. Massachusetts is also one
of the few states in which the legislature meets in annual session.<a name="fa11r" id="fa11r" href="#ft11r"><span class="sp">11</span></a>
Townships were represented as such in this body (called the
General Court) until 1856. Religious qualifications for suffrage
and office-holding were somewhat relaxed, except in the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page855" id="page855"></a>855</span>
Roman Catholics, after 1691.<a name="fa12r" id="fa12r" href="#ft12r"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Real toleration in public opinion
grew slowly through the 18th century, removing the religious
tests of voters; and a constitutional amendment in 1821 explicitly
forbade such tests in the case of office-holders. Property qualifications
for the suffrage and for office-holding&mdash;universal through
colonial times&mdash;were abolished in the main in 1780. From 1821
to 1891 the payment of at least a poll-tax was a condition precedent
to the exercise of the suffrage. An educational test
(dating from 1857) is exacted for the privilege of voting, every
voter being required to be able to read the constitution of the
commonwealth in the English language, and to write his name.
The property qualification of the governor was not abolished until
1892. In the presidential election of 1896, when an unprecedentedly
large vote was cast, the number of voters registered
was nearly 20% of the population, and of these nearly 82%
actually voted. Massachusetts is one of the only two states in
the Union in which elections for state officers are held annually.
In 1888 an act was passed providing for the use in state elections
of a blanket ballot, on which the names of all candidates for
each office are arranged alphabetically under the heading of
that office, and there is no arrangement in party columns. This
was the first state law of the kind in the country. The same
method of voting has been adopted in about two-thirds of the
townships of the state. A limited suffrage was conferred upon
women in 1879. Every female citizen having the qualifications
of a male voter may vote in the city and town elections for
members of the school committee.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A householder with a family may, by recording the proper declaration
in a registry of deeds, hold exempt from attachment, levy on
execution, and sale for the payment of debts thereafter contracted
an estate of homestead, not exceeding $800 in value, in a farm or
lot with buildings thereon which he lawfully possesses by lease or
otherwise and occupies as his residence. The exemption does not
extend, however, to the prohibition of sale for taxes, and in case
the householder&rsquo;s buildings are on land which he has leased those
buildings are not exempt from sale or levy for the ground rent. If
the householder has a wife he can mortgage or convey his estate
of homestead only with her consent, and if he dies leaving a widow
or minor children the homestead exemption survives until the
youngest child is twenty-one years of age, or until the death or
marriage of the widow, provided the widow or a child continues to
occupy it.</p>

<p>The scope of state activity has become somewhat remarkable.
In addition to the usual state boards of education (1837), agriculture
(1852), railroad commissioners (1869), health (1869), statistics of
labour, fisheries and game, charity (1879), the dairy bureau (1891),
of insanity (1898), prison, highways, insurance and banking commissions,
there are also commissions on ballot-law, voting machines,
civil service (1884), uniformity of legislation, gas and electric lighting
corporations, conciliation and arbitration in labour disputes (1886),
&amp;c. There are efficient state boards of registration in pharmacy,
dentistry and medicine. Foods and drugs have been inspected
since 1882. In general it may be said that the excellence of
administrative results is noteworthy. The work of the Bureau
of Statistics of Labor, of the Bureau of Health, of the Board of
Railroad Commissioners, and of the Board of Conciliation and
Arbitration, and the progress of civil service, have been remarkable
for value and efficiency. Almost all state employees are under civil
service rules; the same is true of the city of Boston; and of the
clerical, stenographic, prison, police, civil engineering, fire, labour-foreman,
inspection and bridge tender services of all cities; and
under a law (1894) by which cities and towns may on petition enlarge
the application of their civil service rules. Various other public
services, including even common labourers of the larger towns, are
rapidly passing under civil service regulation. Veterans of the Civil
War have privileges in the administration of the state service. In
the settlement of labour disputes conciliatory methods were successful
in the formative period, when the parties to disputes adopted
customary attitudes of hostility and fought to the end unless they
were reconciled by the Board to a final agreement or to an agreement
to arbitrate.<a name="fa13r" id="fa13r" href="#ft13r"><span class="sp">13</span></a> In this earlier period (before 1900), thanks to the
efforts of the board there was an increase in the frequency of appeal
to arbitration, and settlements by compromise were often made.
Afterwards the number of arbitrations by the board increased in
number: from 1900 to 1908 (inclusive), of 568 controversies submitted
to the board, 525 were settled by an award and 43 by an
induced agreement. In the same period the mediation of the Board
settled disputes affecting 5560 establishments; and in the latter
half of this period labour disputes involving hostilities and of the
magnitude contemplated by the statute governing the Board of
Conciliation and Arbitration had almost disappeared. The laws
relating to labour are full, but, as compared with those of other
states, present few features calling for comment.<a name="fa14r" id="fa14r" href="#ft14r"><span class="sp">14</span></a> In 1899 eight
hours were made to constitute a day&rsquo;s work for all labourers employed
by or for any city or town adopting the act at an annual election.
Acts have been passed extending the common-law liability of
employers, prohibiting the manufacture and sale of sweat-shop
clothing, and authorizing cities and towns to provide free lectures
and to maintain public baths, gymnasia and playgrounds. Boston
has been a leader in the establishment of municipal baths. The
state controls and largely maintains two beaches magnificently
equipped near the city. The Massachusetts railroad commission,
though preceded in point of time by that of New Hampshire of 1844,
was the real beginning of modern state commissions. Its powers
do not extend to direct and mandatory regulation, being supervisory
and advisory only, but it can make recommendations at its discretion,
appealing if necessary to the General Court; and it has had
great influence and excellent results. The Torrens system of land
registration was adopted in 1898, and a court created for its administration.
In the case of all quasi-public corporations rigid laws
exist prohibiting the issue of stock or bonds unless the par value
is first paid in; prohibiting the declaration of any stock or scrip
dividend, and requiring that new stock shall be offered to stockholders
at not less than its market value, to be determined by the
proper state officials, any shares not so subscribed for to be sold
by public auction. These laws are to prevent fictitious capitalization
and &ldquo;stock-watering.&rdquo; In the twenty years preceding 1880
60% of all sentences for crime were found traceable to liquor. In
1881 a local option law was passed, by which the granting of licences
for the sale of liquor was confined to cities and towns voting at the
annual election to authorize their issue. In 1888 the number of
licences to be granted in municipalities voting in favour of their
issue was limited to one for each 1000 inhabitants, except in Boston,
where one licence may be issued for every 500 inhabitants. The
vote varies from year to year, and it is not unusual for a certain
number of municipalities to change from &ldquo;licence&rdquo; to &ldquo;no licence,&rdquo;
and vice versa. The general result has been that centres of population,
especially where the foreign element is large, usually vote for licence,
while those in which native population predominates, as well as the
smaller towns, usually vote for prohibition. Through a growing
acquiescence in the operation of the local option law, the relative
importance of the vote of the Prohibition Party has diminished.
Since 1895 indeterminate sentences have been imposed on all convicts
sentenced to the state prison otherwise than for life or as
habitual criminals; <i>i.e.</i> maximum and minimum terms are established
by law and on the expiration of the latter a revocable permit
of liberty may be issued. Execution by electricity has been the
death penalty since 1898. Stringent legislation controls prison
labour.</p>

<p>The extension of state activity presents some surprising features
in view of the strength of local self-sufficiency nurtured by the old
system of township government. But this form of pure democracy
was in various cases long since inevitably abandoned: by Boston
reluctantly in 1822, and subsequently by many other townships
or cities, as growing population made action in town meeting unbearably
cumbersome. In modern times state activity has encroached
on the cities. Especially has the commonwealth undertaken certain
noteworthy enterprises as the agent of the several municipalities
in the immediate vicinity of Boston, constituting what is known as
the Metropolitan District; as, for example, in bringing water thither
from the Nashua River at Clinton, 40 m. from Boston, and in the
development of a magnificent park system of woods, fells, river-banks
and seashore, unrivalled elsewhere in the country. The commonwealth
joined the city of Boston in the construction of a subway
beneath the most congested portion of the city for the passage of
electric cars. For the better accommodation of the increasing
commerce of the port of Boston, the commonwealth bought a considerable
frontage upon the harbour lines and constructed a dock
capable of receiving the largest vessels, and has supplemented the
work of the United States government in deepening the approaches
to the wharves. It has secured as public reservations the summit
and sides of Greylock (3535 ft.) in the north-west corner of the
state, and of Wachusett (2108 ft.) near the centre. Since 1885
a large expenditure has been incurred in the abolition of grade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page856" id="page856"></a>856</span>
crossings of railways and highways,<a name="fa15r" id="fa15r" href="#ft15r"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and in 1894 the commonwealth
began the construction and maintenance of state highways.<a name="fa16r" id="fa16r" href="#ft16r"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>Since 1885, in Boston, and since 1894, in Fall River, the administration
of the city police departments, including the granting of
liquor licences, has been in the hands of state commissioners (one
commissioner in Boston, a board in Fall River) appointed by the
governor. But though in each case the result has been an improved
administration, it has been generally conceded that only most
exceptional circumstances can justify such interference with local
self-government, and later attempts to extend the practice have
failed. The referendum has been sparingly used in matters of local
concern. Beginning in 1892 various townships and cities, numbering
18 in 1903, adopted municipal ownership and operation of lighting
works. The gasworks have been notably more successful than the
electric plants.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, as in New England generally, the word &ldquo;town&rdquo;
is used, officially and colloquially, to designate a township, and
during the colonial era the New England town-meeting was a notable
school for education in self-government. The members of the first
group of settlers in these colonies were mostly small farmers, belonged
to the same church, and dwelt in a village for protection
from the Indians. They adapted to these conditions some of the
methods for managing local affairs with which they had been familiar
in England, and called the resultant institution a town. The
territorial extent of each town was determined by its grant or grants
from the general court, which the towns served as agents in the
management of land. A settlement or &ldquo;plantation&rdquo; was sometimes
incorporated first as a &ldquo;district&rdquo; and later as a town, the
difference being that the latter had the right of corporate representation
in the general court, while the former had no such right. The
towns elected (until 1856) the deputies to the general court, and
were the administrative units for the assessment and collection of
taxes, maintaining churches and schools, organizing and training
the militia, preserving the peace, caring for the poor, building and
repairing roads and bridges, and recording deeds, births, deaths
and marriages; and to discuss questions relating to these matters
as well as other matters of peculiarly local concern, to determine
the amount of taxes for town purposes, and to elect officers. All the
citizens were expected to attend the annual town-meeting, and such
male inhabitants as were not citizens were privileged to attend and
to propose and discuss measures, although they had no right to vote.
Generally several villages have grown up in the same &ldquo;town,&rdquo;
and some of the more populous &ldquo;towns,&rdquo; usually those in which
manufacturing has become more important than farming, have been
incorporated as &ldquo;cities&rdquo;; thus either a town or a city may now
include a farming country and various small villages. Although
the tendency in Massachusetts is towards chartering as cities
&ldquo;towns&rdquo; which have a population of 12,000 or more, the democratic
institution of the town-meeting persists in many large municipalities
which are still technically towns.<a name="fa17r" id="fa17r" href="#ft17r"><span class="sp">17</span></a> Most &ldquo;towns&rdquo; hold their annual
meeting in March, but some hold them in February and others in
April. In the larger &ldquo;towns&rdquo; the officers elected at this meeting
may consist of five, seven or nine selectmen, a clerk, a treasurer,
three or more assessors, three or more overseers of the poor, one
or more collectors of taxes, one or more auditors, one or more
surveyors of highways, a road commissioner, a sewer commissioner,
a board of health, one or more constables, two or more
field drivers, two or more fence viewers, and a tree warden; but
in the smaller &ldquo;towns&rdquo; the number of selectmen may be limited
to three, the selectmen may assess the taxes, be overseers of
the poor, and act as a board of health, and the treasurer or
constable may collect the taxes. The term of all these officers
may be limited to one year, or the selectmen, clerk, assessors and
overseers of the poor may be elected for a term of three years, in
which case a part only of the selectmen, assessors and overseers
of the poor are elected each year. The selectmen have the general
management of a &ldquo;town&rsquo;s&rdquo; affairs during the interval between
town-meetings. They may call special town-meetings; they appoint
election officers and may appoint additional constables or
public officers, and such minor officials as inspectors of milk, inspectors
of buildings, gauger of measures, cullers of staves and hoops,
fish warden and forester. A school committee consisting of any
number of members divisible by three is chosen, one-third each
year, at the annual town-meeting or at a special meeting which is held
in the same month. Any &ldquo;town&rdquo; having a village or district within
its limits that contains 1000 inhabitants or more may authorize that
village or district to establish a separate organization for lighting
its streets, building and maintaining sidewalks, and employing a
watchman or policeman, the officers of such organization to include
at least a prudential committee and a clerk. All laws relative to
&ldquo;towns&rdquo; are applied to &ldquo;cities&rdquo; in so far as they are not inconsistent
with general or special laws relative to the latter, and the
powers of the selectmen are vested in the mayor and aldermen.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;For cities of above 8000 inhabitants (for which
alone comparative statistics are annually available), in 1902-1903
the ratio of average attendance to school enrolment, the
average number of days&rsquo; attendance of each pupil enrolled, and
the value of school property per capita of pupils in average
attendance were higher than in any other state; the average
length of the school term was slightly exceeded in eight states;
and the total cost of the schools per capita of pupils in average
attendance ($39.05) was exceeded in six other states. In 1905-1906
the percentage of average attendance in the public schools
to the number of children (between 5 and 15 years) in the state
was 80; in Barnstable county it was 95, and in Plymouth 92;
and the lowest rate of any county was 68, that of Bristol. In
the same year the amount of the various school taxes and other
contributions was $30.53 for each child in the average membership
of the public schools, and the highest amount for each child
in any county was $35.77 in Suffolk county, and in any township
or city $68.01&mdash;in Lincoln. The school system is not one of
marked state centralization&mdash;as contrasted, <i>e.g.</i> with New
York. A state board of education has general control, its
secretary acting as superintendent of the state system in
conjunction with local superintendents and committees. Women
are eligible for these positions, and among the teachers in the
schools they are greatly in excess over men (more than 10 to 1),
especially in lower grades. No recognition exists in the schools
of race, colour or religion. The proportion of the child population
that attends schools is equalled in but two or three states
east of the Mississippi river. The services of Horace Mann (<i>q.v.</i>)
as secretary of the state board (1837-1848) were productive of
almost revolutionary benefits not only to Massachusetts but to
the entire country. His reforms, which reached every part of the
school system, were fortunately introduced just at the beginning
of railway and city growth. Since 1850 truant and compulsory
attendance laws (the first compulsory education law was passed
in 1642) have been enforced in conjunction with laws against
child labour. In 1900 the average period of schooling per inhabitant
for the United States was 4.3 years, for Massachusetts 7
years. (The same year the ratio of wealth productivity was as
66 to 37.) Massachusetts stands &ldquo;foremost in the Union in
the universality of its provision for secondary education.&rdquo;<a name="fa18r" id="fa18r" href="#ft18r"><span class="sp">18</span></a>
The laws practically offer such education free to every child of
the commonwealth. Illiterate persons not less than ten years
of age constituted in 1900 5.9% of the population; and 0.8,
14.6, 10.7% respectively of native whites, foreign-born whites
and negroes. More patents are issued, relatively, to citizens of
Massachusetts than to those of any other state except Connecticut.
Post office statistics indicate a similarly high average of
intelligence.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The public school system includes common, high and normal
schools, and various evening, industrial and truant schools. Many
townships and cities maintain free evening schools. In 1894 manual
training was made a part of the curriculum in all municipalities
having 20,000 inhabitants. There are also many private business
colleges, academic schools and college-preparatory schools. The
high schools enjoy an exceptional reputation. An unusual proportion
of teachers in the public schools are graduates of the state
normal schools, of which the first were founded in 1839 at Lexington
and Barre, the former being the first normal school of the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page857" id="page857"></a>857</span>
States.<a name="fa19r" id="fa19r" href="#ft19r"><span class="sp">19</span></a> These two schools were removed subsequently to Framingham
(1853) and Westfield (1844), where they are still active; while
others flourish at Bridgewater (1840), Salem (1854), Worcester
(1874), Fitchburg (1895), North Adams (1897), Hyannis (1897) and
Lowell (1897), that at Framingham being open to women only.
There is also a state normal art school at Boston (1873) for both
sexes.</p>

<p>The commonwealth contributes to the support of textile schools
in cities in which 450,000 spindles are in operation. Such schools
exist (1909) in Lowell, Fall River and New Bedford. The commonwealth
also maintains aboard a national ship a nautical training
school (1891) for instruction in the science and practice of navigation.
During the Spanish-American War of 1898 more than half
of the graduates and cadets of the school enlisted in the United
States service.</p>

<p>There are several hundred private schools, whose pupils constituted
in 1905-1906 15.7% of the total school-enrolment of the
state. Of higher academies and college-preparatory schools there
are scores. Among those for boys Phillips Academy, at Andover,
the Groton school, and the Mount Hermon school are well-known
examples. For girls the largest school is the Northfield Seminary
at East Northfield. In Boston and in the towns in its environs
are various famous schools, among them the boys&rsquo; classical school
in Boston, founded in 1635, one of the oldest secondary schools in
the country. The leading educational institution of the state, as it
is the oldest and most famous of the country, is Harvard University
(founded 1636) at Cambridge. In the extreme north-west of the
state, at Williamstown, is Williams College (1793), and in the Connecticut
Valley is Amherst College (1821), both of these unsectarian.
Boston University (Methodist Episcopal, 1867); Tufts College
(1852), a few miles from Boston in Medford, originally a Universalist
school; Clark University (1889, devoted wholly to graduate instruction
until 1902, when Clark College was added), at Worcester,
are important institutions. Two Roman Catholic schools are
maintained&mdash;Boston College (1863) and the College of the Holy
Cross (1843), at Worcester. Of various institutions for the education
of women, Mount Holyoke (1837) at South Hadley, Smith College
(1875) at Northampton, Wellesley College (1875) at Wellesley near
Boston, Radcliffe College (1879) in connexion with Harvard at
Cambridge and Simmons College (1899) at Boston, are of national
repute. The last emphasizes scientific instruction in domestic
economy.</p>

<p>For agricultural students the state supports a school at Amherst
(1867), and Harvard University the Bussey Institution. In technological
science special instruction is given&mdash;in addition to the scientific
departments of the schools already mentioned&mdash;in the Worcester
Polytechnic Institute (1865), and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (opened in 1865). There are schools of theology at
Cambridge (Protestant Episcopal), Newton (Baptist) and Waltham
(New Church), as well as in connexion with Boston University
(Methodist), Tufts College (Universalist) and Harvard (non-sectarian,
and the affiliated Congregational Andover Theological Seminary
at Cambridge). Law and medical schools are maintained in Boston
and Harvard universities.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Public Institutions.</i>&mdash;Massachusetts was in 1903, in proportion
to the population, more richly provided with public collections of
books than any other state: in that year she had nearly a
seventh of all books in public, society and school libraries in
the country, and a much larger supply of books per capita (2.56)
than any other state. The rate for New York, the only state
having a larger number of books in such libraries, being only 1.19.
The Boston public library, exceeded in size in the United States
by the library of Congress at Washington&mdash;and probably first,
because of the large number of duplicates in the library of Congress&mdash;and
the largest free municipal library in the world; the
library of Harvard, extremely well chosen and valuable for
research; the collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society
(1791); the Boston Athenaeum (1807); the State Library (1826);
the New England Historic Genealogical Society (1845); the Congregational
Library; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
(1780); and the Boston Society of Natural History (1830), all in
Boston, leave it easily unrivalled, unless by Washington, as the
best research centre of the country. The collections of the
American Antiquarian Society (1812) at Worcester are also
notable. Massachusetts led, about 1850, in the founding of
town and city libraries supported by public taxes, and by 1880
had established more of such institutions than existed in all
other states combined. In 1900 out of 353 towns and cities
only five, representing less than half of 1%, were without free
library facilities, and three of these five had association libraries
charging only a small fee.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The state is very well supplied with charitable and reformatory
institutions, in which noteworthy methods have been employed
with success. The state institutions, each governed by a board
of trustees, and all under the supervision of the state board of
charity, include a state hospital at Tewksbury, for paupers (1866);
a state farm at Bridgewater (1887) for paupers and petty criminals;
the Lyman school for boys at Westboro, a reformatory for male
criminals under fifteen years of age sentenced to imprisonment for
terms less than life in connexion with which a very successful farm
is maintained for the younger boys at Berlin; an industrial school
for girls at Lancaster, also a reformatory school&mdash;a third reformatory
school for boys was planned in 1909; a state sanatorium at Rutland
for tuberculous patients (the first public hospital for such in the
United States) and a hospital school at Canton for the care and
instruction of crippled and deformed children. Three more hospitals
for consumptives were planned in 1909. Under the supervision
of the state board of insanity, and each under the government of
a board of seven trustees (of whom two are women) are state hospitals
for the insane at Worcester (1833), Taunton, Northampton, Danvers,
Westboro and Medford, a state colony for the insane at Gardner,
a state hospital for epileptics at Palmer, a state school for the feeble-minded
at Waltham (governed by six trustees), a state school at
Wrentham, state &ldquo;hospital cottages for children&rdquo; (1882) at Baldwinville
(governed by five trustees), and the Foxboro state hospital for
dipsomaniacs and insane. There are also semi-state institutions
for the insane at Waverley, Barre, Wrentham and Baldwinville,
and nineteen small private institutions, all under the supervision
of the state board of insanity. Under the supervision of a board
of prison commissioners, which appoints the superintendent and
warden of each, are a reformatory prison for women at Sherborn
(1877), a state reformatory for men at Concord (1884), a state prison
at Boston (Charlestown), and a prison camp and hospital at Rutland
(1905). There is a prison department at the state farm which
receives misdemeanants. Other institutions receiving state aid,
each governed by trustees appointed by the governor, are the
Massachusetts general hospital at Boston, the Massachusetts charitable
eye and ear infirmary at Boston, the Massachusetts homoeopathic
hospital at Boston, the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts
school for the blind at South Boston and the soldiers&rsquo; home in
Massachusetts at Boston. The Horace Mann school in Boston,
a public day school for the deaf, the New England industrial school
for deaf mutes at Beverly and the Clarke school for the deaf at
Northampton are maintained in part by the state. Finally, many
private charitable corporations (about 500 in 1905) report to the
state board of charity, and town and city almshouses (205 in 1904)
are subject to visitation. The Perkins Institution is memorable
for its association with the fame of S. G. Howe (g.v.), whose reforms
in charity methods were felt through all the charitable interests
of the state. The net yearly cost of support and relief from 1884
to 1904 averaged $2,136,653, exclusive of vagrancy cases (average
$31,714). The whole number of paupers, besides vagrants, in 1908
was 23.02 per 1000 of state population, and the cost of relief
($5,104,255) was $1.699 for each inhabitant of the state. The
number of sane paupers declined steadily and markedly from 1863
to 1904.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;Massachusetts is a very rich state, and Boston
a very wealthy city. The debt of the state (especially the contingent
debt, secured by sinking funds) has been steadily rising
since 1888, and especially since 1896, chiefly owing to the erection
of important public buildings, the construction of state
highways and metropolitan park roadways, the improvement
of Boston harbour, the abolition of grade crossings on railways,
and the expenses incurred for the Spanish-American War of
1898.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The net direct funded debt (also secured by accumulating sinking
funds) in December 1908 was $17,669,372 (3.61 millions in 1893).
The average interest on this and the contingent debt ($60,428,223
in December 1908) combined was only 3.35%. The net debts of
towns and cities rose in the years 1885-1908 from $63,306,213 to
$163,558,325. The county debts in 1908 aggregated $6,076,867. The
assessed valuation of realty in the state in 1908 was $2,799,062,707
and of personalty $1,775,073,438. No other state has given so
vigorous a test of the ordinary American general-property tax, and
the results have been as discouraging as elsewhere. The &ldquo;dooming&rdquo;
process (<i>i.e.</i> estimation by assessors, without relief for overvaluation
except for excess more than 50% above the proper
valuation) was introduced in 1868 as a method of securing returns
of personalty. But the most rigorous application of the doomage
law has only proved its complete futility as an effort to reach unascertained
corporate and personal property.<a name="fa20r" id="fa20r" href="#ft20r"><span class="sp">20</span></a> Various special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page858" id="page858"></a>858</span>
methods are used for the taxation of banks, insurance companies,
railways, tramways, trust companies and corporations, some of
them noteworthy. In the case of corporations realty and machinery
are taxed generally by the local authorities, and stock values by
the commonwealth. The Boston stock exchange is the second of
the country in the extent of the securities in which it deals. The
proportion of holders of U.S. bonds among the total population is
higher than that in any other state.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;It is possible that the coasts of Massachusetts were
visited by the Northmen, and by the earliest navigators who
followed Cabot, but this is only conjecture. In 1602 Bartholomew
Gosnold landed at and named Cape Cod and coasted as far
south as the present No-Man&rsquo;s Land, which he named Martin&rsquo;s
or Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, a name later transferred to a neighbouring
larger island. Pring and Champlain at a later date coasted
along what is now Massachusetts, but the map of Champlain is
hardly recognizable. The first sufficient explorations for cartographical
record were made by John Smith in 1614, and his map
was long the basis&mdash;particularly in its nomenclature&mdash;of later
maps. Permanency of occupation, however, dates from the
voyage of the &ldquo;Mayflower,&rdquo; which brought about a hundred
men, women and children who had mostly belonged to an English
sect of Separatists, originating in Yorkshire, but who had passed
a period of exile for religion&rsquo;s sake in Holland. In the early
winter of 1620 they made the coast of Cape Cod; they had
intended to make their landing farther south, within the jurisdiction
of the Virginia Company, which had granted them a
patent; but stress of weather prevented their doing so. Finding
themselves without warrant in a region beyond their patent,
and threatened with the desertion of disaffected members of their
company (probably all servants or men of the &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; sort)
unless concessions were made to these, they drew up and signed
before landing a democratic compact of government which is
accounted the earliest written constitution in history.<a name="fa21r" id="fa21r" href="#ft21r"><span class="sp">21</span></a> After
some exploration of the coast they made a permanent landing
on the 21st of December 1620 (N.S.) at Plymouth, a
harbour which had already been so named by John Smith in
his maps of 1614 and 1616. During the first winter nearly one-half
their number died from exposure, and the relations of the
survivors with their partners of the London Company, who had
insisted that for seven years the plantation should be managed
as a joint stock company, were unsatisfactory. However,
about thirty-five new colonists arrived in 1622 and ninety-six
more in 1623. The abandonment of the communal system was
begun in the latter year, and with the dissolution of the partnership
with the adventurers of the London Company in 1627
Plymouth became a corporate colony with its chief authority
vested in the whole body of freemen convened in the General
Court. Upon the death of the first governor, John Carver, in
the spring of 1621, the General Court chose William Bradford
as his successor, and with him was chosen one assistant. The
subsequent elections were annual, and within a few years the
number of assistants was increased to seven. The General
Court was the legislature and the electorate; the governor and
assistants were the executive and the judiciary. The whole
body of freemen composed the General Court until other towns
than Plymouth had been organized, the first of which were
Scituate in 1636 and Duxbury in 1637, and then the representative
form of government was adopted and there was a gradual
differentiation between Plymouth the town and Plymouth the
colony. When it had become known that the colony was within
the territory of the New England Council, John Pierce, in 1621,
procured from that body a grant which made the colonists its
tenants. A year later Pierce surrendered this and procured
another, which in effect made him proprietor of the colony, but
he was twice shipwrecked and was forced to assign to the adventurers
his second patent. In 1629 Governor Bradford procured
from the same council a definite grant of the tract which corresponds
to the south-eastern portion of the present state. But
all attempts to procure a royal charter for Plymouth Colony were
unsuccessful, and in 1691 it was annexed to the Colony of Massachusetts
Bay under what is termed the Provincial Charter.</p>

<p>King James having by patent in 1620 created a Council for
New England to whom he made a large grant of territory, the
council in 1628 made a sub-grant, confirmed by a royal charter
that passed the seals on the 4th of March 1629, to the &ldquo;Governor
and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in Newe England.&rdquo;
There had been various minor expeditions during the few years
since Smith was on the coast before this company, in the Puritan
interests, had sent over John Endecott with a party in 1628 to
what is now Salem. In 1630 the government of the company,
with questionable right (for the charter seems evidently to have
contemplated the residence of the company in England), transferred
itself to their territory, and under the leadership of John
Winthrop laid the foundations anew of the Massachusetts colony,
when they first settled Boston in the autumn of that year.
Winthrop served repeatedly, though not continuously, as governor
of the colony till his death in 1649, his rejection in 1636 being
due to a party of theological revolt which chose Henry Vane
(afterwards Sir Henry) to the office. This was an incident in a
famous episode, important rather as a symptom than in itself,
namely, the Antinomian controversy, &ldquo;New England&rsquo;s earliest
protest against formulas,&rdquo; in which Vane and Ann Hutchinson
took the lead in criticizing the official orthodoxy of the colony.</p>

<p>The magistrates successfully asserted themselves to the discomfiture
of their critics (Ann Hutchinson being banished),
and this was characteristic of the colony&rsquo;s early history. The
charter gave the company control over the admission of &ldquo;freemen&rdquo;
(co-partners in the enterprise, and voters), &ldquo;full and
absolute power and authority to correct, punish and rule&rdquo;
subjects settling in the territory comprised in their grant, and
power to &ldquo;resist ... by all fitting ways and means whatever&rdquo;
all persons attempting the &ldquo;destruction, invasion, detriment or
annoyance&rdquo; of the plantation. Some writers deny the company&rsquo;s
right under this instrument to rule as they proceeded to do;
but at any rate what they did was to make the suffrage dependent
on stringent religious tests, and to repress with determined
zeal all theological &ldquo;vagaries&rdquo; and &ldquo;whimsies.&rdquo; Criticism of
church or magistrates was not tolerated. Laws were modelled
closely on the Bible. The clergy were a ruling class. The
government was frankly theocratic. Said Winthrop (1637):
&ldquo;We see not that any should have authority to set up any other
exercises besides what authority hath already set up&rdquo;; and a
synod at Cambridge in 1637 catalogued eighty-two &ldquo;opinions,
some blasphemous, others erroneous and all unsafe,&rdquo; besides
nine &ldquo;unwholesome expressions,&rdquo; all of which were consigned
&ldquo;to the devil of hell from whence they came.&rdquo; Another synod
at Cambridge in 1647 more formally established the principle
of state control. The legislation against Baptists (about 1644-1678)
and the persecution of the Quakers (especially 1656-1662)
partook of the brutality of the time, including scourging, boring
of tongues, cutting of ears and in rare cases capital punishment. It
cannot be denied that men like Roger Williams and some of the
persecuted Quakers, though undeniably contentious and aggressive
in their conscientious dissent, showed a spirit which to-day
seems sweeter in tolerance and humanity than that of the Puritans.
And it seems necessary to emphasize these facts because
until about 1870 it was almost unchallenged tradition to regard
the men of Massachusetts Bay as seekers and champions of
&ldquo;religious liberty.&rdquo; They left England, indeed, for liberty
to discard the &ldquo;poperies&rdquo; of the English Church, and once
in Massachusetts they even discarded far more than those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page859" id="page859"></a>859</span>
&ldquo;poperies.&rdquo; But religious liberty in our modern sense they did
not seek for themselves, nor accord to others; they abhorred it,
they trampled on it, and their own lives they subjected to all the
rigid restrictions to which they subjected others. They were
narrow but strong; no better example can be imagined of what the
French call &ldquo;the defects of one&rsquo;s qualities.&rdquo; Their failures were
small compared with those of their contemporaries in England
and elsewhere in Europe, and public opinion did not long sustain
violent persecution of opinion. More than once mobs freed
Quaker prisoners. Also it is to be said that with the single
exception of religious toleration the record of the state in devotion
to human rights has been from the first a splendid one,
whether in human principles of criminal law, or in the defence
of the civil rights commonly declared in American constitutions.
It was once generally assumed that the repression practised
attained its end of securing harmony of opinion. The fact
seems to be that intellectual speculation was as strong in America
as in Puritan England; the assumption that the inhibition of its
expression was good seems wholly gratuitous, and contrary to
general convictions underlying modern freedom of speech. A
safer opinion is probably that &ldquo;the spiritual growth of Massachusetts
withered under the shadow of dominant orthodoxy;
the colony was only saved from mental atrophy by its vigorous
political life&rdquo; (J. A. Doyle). In literature the second half of
the 17th century is a sterile waste of forbidding theology; and
its life, judged by the present day, singularly sombre.</p>

<p>In addition to the few persons banished to Rhode Island,
theological and political differences led many to emigrate thither.
Others, discontented with Massachusetts autocracy and wishing,
too, &ldquo;to secure more room,&rdquo; went to Connecticut (<i>q.v.</i>) where
they established a bulwark against the Dutch of New York.</p>

<p>A witchcraft scare (at its worst in 1691-1697, though the
earliest Connecticut case was in 1646-1647 and the earliest in
Boston in 1648) led to another tragedy of ignorance. In all
thirty-two persons were executed (according to W. F. Poole,
about a thousandth part of those executed for witchcraft in the
British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries). Salem was the
scene of the greatest excitement in 1691-1692.</p>

<p>Exceptionally honourable to the early colonists was their
devotion to education (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harvard University</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Boston</a></span>).
Massachusetts Bay had a large learned element; it is supposed
that about 1640 there was an Oxford or Cambridge graduate
to every 250 persons in the colony. The earliest printing
in the British-American colonies was done at Cambridge in
1639; it was not until 1674 that the authorities of the colony
permitted printing, except at Cambridge. Boston and Cambridge
remain leading publishing centres to-day. The first
regular newspaper of Boston, the <i>Boston Newsletter</i>, was the
pioneer of the American newspaper press.</p>

<p>The early history was rendered unquiet at times by wars
with the Indians, the chief of which were the Pequot War
in 1637, and King Philip&rsquo;s War in 1675-76; and for better
combining against these enemies, Massachusetts, with Connecticut,
New Haven and New Plymouth, formed a confederacy
in 1643, considered the prototype of the larger union of the
colonies which conducted the War of American Independence
(1775-83). The struggle with the Crown, which ended in
independence, began at the foundation of the colony, with
assumptions of power under the charter which the colonial
government was always trying to maintain, and the crown
was as assiduously endeavouring to counteract. After more
than half a century of struggle, the crown finally annulled
the charter of the colony in 1684, though not until 1686 was
the old government actually supplanted on the arrival of Joseph
Dudley, a native of the colony, as president of a provisional
council; later, Sir Edmund Andros was sent over with a commission
to unite New York and New England under his rule.
The colonists had been for many years almost independent;
they made their own laws, the Crown appointed natives as
officials, and the colonial interpretation of the old charter
had in general been allowed to stand. Massachusetts had
excluded the English Book of Common Prayer, she had restricted
the franchise, laid the death penalty on religious opinions,
and passed various other laws repugnant to the Crown, notably
to Charles II. and James II.; she had caused laws and writs
to run in her own name, she had neglected to exact the oath
of allegiance to the sovereign, though carefully exacting an
oath of fidelity to her own government, she had protected
the regicides, she had coined money with her own seal, she
had blocked legal appeals to the English courts, she had not
compelled the observance of the navigation acts. The revocation
of the charter aroused the strongest fears of the colonists
Andros speedily met determined opposition by measures undertaken
relative to taxation and land titles, by efforts to secure
a church for Episcopal service, and an attempt to curb the
town meetings. His government was supported by a small
party (largely an Anglican Church party), but was intensely
unpopular with the bulk of the people; and&mdash;it is a disputed
question, whether before or after news arrived of the landing
in England of William of Orange&mdash;in April 1689 the citizens
of Boston rose in revolution, deposed Andros, imprisoned him
and re-established their old colonial form of government. Then
came a struggle, carried on in England by Increase Mather as
agent (1688-1692) of the colony, to secure such a form of government
under a new charter as would preserve as many as possible
of their old liberties. Plymouth Colony, acting through its
agent in London, endeavoured to secure a separate existence
by royal charter, but accepted finally union with Massachusetts
when association with New York became the probable alternative.
The province of Maine was also united in the new
provincial charter of 1691, and Sir William Phips came over
with it, commissioned as the first royal governor. As has been
mentioned already, the new charter softened religious tests
for office and the suffrage, and accorded &ldquo;liberty of conscience&rdquo;
except to Roman Catholics. The old religious exclusiveness
had already been greatly lessened: the clergy were less powerful,
heresy had thrived under repression, Anglican churchmen had
come to the colony and were borne with perforce, devotion to
trade and commerce had weakened theological tests in favour
of ideals of mere good order and prosperity, and a spirit of
toleration had grown.</p>

<p>Throughout the continuance of the government under the
provincial charter, there was a constant struggle between a
prerogative party, headed by the royal governor, and a popular
party who cherished recollections of their practical independence
under the colonial charter, and who were nursing the sentiments
which finally took the form of resistance in 1775. The inter-charter
period, 1686-1691, is of great importance in this connexion.
The popular majority kept up the feeling of hostility to
the royal authority in recurrent combats in the legislative
assembly over the salary to be voted to the governor; though
these antagonisms were from time to time forgotten in the wars
with the French and Indians. During the earl of Bellomont&rsquo;s
administration, New York was again united with Massachusetts
under the same executive (1697-1701). The scenes of the
recurrent wars were mostly distant from Massachusetts proper,
either in Maine or on Canadian or Acadian territory, although
some savage inroads of the Indians were now and then made on
the exposed frontier towns, as, for instance, upon Deerfield
in 1704 and upon Haverhill in 1708. Phips, who had succeeded
in an attack on Port Royal, had ignominiously failed when
he led the Massachusetts fleet against Quebec in 1690; and the
later expedition of 1711 was no less a failure. The most noteworthy
administration was that of William Shirley (1741-1749
and 1753-1756), who at one time was the commanding officer
of the British forces in North America. He made a brilliant
success of the expedition against Louisburg in 1745, William
Pepperell, a Maine officer, being in immediate command.
Shirley with Massachusetts troops also took part in the Oswego
expedition of 1755; and Massachusetts proposed, and lent the
chief assistance in the expedition of Nova Scotia in 1755
which ended in the removal of the Acadians. Her officers and
troops also played an important part in the Crown Point and
second Louisburg expedition (1758).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page860" id="page860"></a>860</span></p>

<p>The first decided protests against the exercise of sovereign
power by the crown, the first general moral and political revolt
that marked the approach of the American War of Independence,
took place in Massachusetts; so that the most striking events
in the general history of the colonies as a whole from 1760
to 1775 are an intimate part of her annals. The beginning
of the active opposition to the crown may be placed in the
resistance, led by James Otis, to the issuing of writs (after
1752, Otis&rsquo;s famous argument against them being made in 1760-1761)
to compel citizens to assist the revenue officers; followed
later by the outburst of feeling at the imposition of the Stamp
Act (1765), when Massachusetts took the lead in confronting
the royal power. The governors put in office at this time
by the crown were not of conciliatory temperaments, and the
measures instituted in parliament (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">United States</a></span>) served
to increase bitterness of feeling. Royal troops sent to Boston
(several regiments, 1768) irritated the populace, who were highly
excited at the time, until in an outbreak on the 5th of March
1770 a file of garrison troops shot down in self-defence a few
citizens in a crowd which assailed them. This is known as
the &ldquo;Boston Massacre.&rdquo; The merchants combined to prevent
the importation of goods which by law would yield the crown
a revenue; and the patriots&mdash;as the anti-prerogative party
called themselves&mdash;under the lead of Samuel Adams, instituted
regular communication between the different towns, and afterwards,
following the initiative of Virginia, with the other colonies,
through &ldquo;committees of correspondence&rdquo;; a method of the
utmost advantage thereafter in forcing on the revolution
by intensifying and unifying the resistance of the colony, and
by inducing the co-operation of other colonies. In 1773
(Dec. 16) a party of citizens, disguised as Indians and
instigated by popular meetings, boarded some tea-ships
in the harbour of Boston, and to prevent the landing of their
taxable cargoes threw them into the sea; this incident is known
in history as the &ldquo;Boston tea-party.&rdquo; Parliament in retaliation
closed the port of Boston (1774), a proceeding which only
aroused more bitter feeling in the country towns and enlisted
the sympathy of the other colonies. The governorship was
now given to General Thomas Gage, who commanded the
troops which had been sent to Boston. Everything foreboded
an outbreak. Most of the families of the highest social position
were averse to extreme measures; a large number were not won
over and became expatriated loyalists. The popular agitators,
headed by Samuel Adams&mdash;with whom John Hancock, an
opulent merchant and one of the few of the richer people who
deserted the crown, leagued himself&mdash;forced on the movement,
which became war in April 1775, when Gage sent an expedition
to Concord and Lexington to destroy military stores accumulated
by the patriots and to capture Adams and Hancock, temporarily
staying at Lexington. This detachment, commanded by
Lord Percy, was assaulted, and returned with heavy loss.
The country towns now poured their militia into Cambridge,
opposite Boston; troops came from neighbouring colonies,
and Artemas Ward, a Massachusetts general, was placed in
command of the irregular force, which with superior numbers
at once shut the royal army up in Boston. An attempt of
the provincials to seize and hold a commanding hill in Charlestown
brought on the battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775),
in which the provincials were driven from the ground,
although they lost much less heavily than the royal troops.
Washington, chosen by the Continental Congress to command
the army, arrived in Cambridge in July 1775, and stretching
his lines around Boston, forced its evacuation in March 1776.
The state was not again the scene of any conflict during the
war. Generals Henry Knox and Benjamin Lincoln were the
most distinguished officers contributed by the state to the
revolutionary army. Out of an assessment at one time upon
the states of $5,000,000 for the expenses of the war, Massachusetts
was charged with $820,000, the next highest being $800,000
for Virginia. Of the 231,791 troops sent by all the colonies
into the field, reckoning by annual terms, Massachusetts
sent 67,907, the next highest being 31,939 from Connecticut,
Virginia furnishing only 26,678; and her proportion of sailors
was very much greater still. In every campaign in every
colony save in 1770-80 her soldiery were in absolute, and still
more in relative, number greater than those of any other colony.</p>

<p>After the outbreak of the war a somewhat indefinite, heterogeneous
provisional government was in power till a constitution
was adopted in 1780, when John Hancock became the first
governor. Governor James Bowdoin in 1786-1787 put down
with clemency an almost bloodless insurrection in the western
counties (there was strong disaffection, however, as far east
as Middlesex), known as the Shays Rebellion, significant of
the rife ideas of popular power, the economic distress, and the
unsettled political conditions of the years of the Confederation.
Daniel Shays (1747-1825), the leader, was a brave Revolutionary
captain of no special personal importance. The state debt
was large, taxation was heavy, and industry was unsettled;
worthless paper money was in circulation, yet some men demanded
more; debtors were made desperate by prosecution;
the state government seemed weak, the Federal government
contemptibly so; the local courts would not, or from intimidation
feared to, punish the turbulent, and demagogues encouraged
ideas of popular power. A convention of delegates representing
the malcontents of numerous towns in Worcester county met
at Worcester on the 15th of August 1786 to consider grievances,
and a week later a similar convention assembled at Hatfield,
Hampshire county. Encouraged by these and other conventions
in order to obstruct the collection of debts and taxes, a mob
prevented a session of the Court of Common Pleas and General
Sessions of the Peace at Northampton on the 29th of August,
and in September other mobs prevented the same court from
sitting in Worcester, Middlesex and Berkshire counties. About
1000 insurgents under Shays assembled at Springfield on the
26th of September to prevent the sitting there of the Supreme
Court, from which they feared indictments. To protect the
court and the national arsenal at Springfield, for which the
Federal government was powerless to provide a guard, Major-General
William Shepard (1737-1817) ordered out the militia,
called for volunteers, and supplied them with arms from the
arsenal, and the court sat for three days. The Federal government
now attempted to enlist recruits, ostensibly to protect
the western frontier from the Indians, but actually for the
suppression of the insurrection; but the plan failed from lack
of funds, and the insurgents continued to interrupt the procedure
of the courts. In January 1787, however, Governor
Bowdoin raised an army of 4400 men and placed it under
the command of Major-General Benjamin Lincoln (1733-1810).
While Lincoln was at Worcester Shays planned to capture
the arsenal at Springfield, but on the 25th of January Shepard&rsquo;s
men fired upon Shays&rsquo;s followers, killing four and putting the
rest to flight. Lincoln pursued them to Petersham, Worcester
county, where on the 4th of February he routed them and
took 150 prisoners. Subsequently the insurgents gathered
in small bands in Berkshire county; but here, a league having
been formed to assist the government, 84 insurgents were
captured at West Stockbridge, and the insurrection practically
terminated in an action at Sheffield on the 27th of February,
in which the insurgents lost 2 killed and 30 wounded and the
militia 2 killed and 1 wounded. Two of the insurgent leaders,
Daniel Shays and Eli Parsons, escaped to Vermont soon after
the rout at Petersham. Fourteen other insurgents who were
tried by the Supreme Court in the spring of 1787 were found
guilty of treason and sentenced to death. They were, however,
held rather as hostages for the good behaviour of worse offenders
who had escaped, and were pardoned in September. In February
1788 Shays and Parsons petitioned for pardon, and this
was granted by the legislature in the following June. The
outcome of the uprising was an encouraging test of loyalty
to the commonwealth; and the insurrection is regarded as
having been very potent in preparing public opinion throughout
the country for the adoption of a stronger national government.
The Federal Constitution was ratified by Massachusetts by
only a small majority on the 6th of February 1788, after its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page861" id="page861"></a>861</span>
rejection had been at one time imminent; but Massachusetts
became a strong Federalist state. Indeed, the general interest
of her history in the quarter-century after the adoption of
the Constitution lies mainly in her connexion with the fortunes
of that great political party. Her leading politicians were
out of sympathy with the conduct of national affairs (in the
conduct of foreign relations, the distribution of political patronage,
naval policy, the question of public debt) from 1804&mdash;when
Jefferson&rsquo;s party showed its complete supremacy&mdash;onward;
and particularly after the passage of the Embargo
Act of 1807, which caused great losses to Massachusetts commerce,
and, so far from being accepted by her leaders as a
proper diplomatic weapon, seemed to them designed in the
interests of the Democratic party. The Federalist preference
for England over France was strong in Massachusetts, and her
sentiment was against the war with England of 1812-15. New
England&rsquo;s discontent culminated in the Hartford Convention
(Dec. 1814), in which Massachusetts men predominated. The
state, however, bore her full part in the war, and much of its
naval success was due to her sailors.</p>

<p>During the interval till the outbreak of the Civil War in
1861, Massachusetts held a distinguished place in national
life and politics. As a state she may justly be said to have
been foremost in the struggle against slavery.<a name="fa22r" id="fa22r" href="#ft22r"><span class="sp">22</span></a> She opposed
the policy that led to the Mexican War in 1846, although a
regiment was raised in Massachusetts by the personal exertions
of Caleb Cushing. The leaders of the ultra non-political abolitionists
(who opposed the formation of the Liberty party)
were mainly Massachusetts men, notably W. L. Garrison and
Wendell Phillips. The Federalist domination had been succeeded
by Whig rule in the state; but after the death of the
great Whig, Daniel Webster, in 1852, all parties disintegrated,
re-aligning themselves gradually in an aggressive anti-slavery
party and the temporizing Democratic party. First, for many
years the Free-Soilers gained strength; then in 1855 in an
extraordinary party upheaval the Know-Nothings quite broke
up Democratic, Free-Soil and Whig organizations; the Free-Soilers
however captured the Know-Nothing organization and
directed it to their own ends; and by their junction with the
anti-slavery Whigs there was formed the Republican party.
To this the original Free-Soilers contributed as leaders Charles
Sumner and C. F. Adams; the Know-Nothings, Henry Wilson
and N. P. Banks; and later, the War Democrats, B. F. Butler&mdash;all
men of mark in the history of the state. Charles Sumner,
the most eminent exponent of the new party, was the
state&rsquo;s senator in Congress (1851-1874). The feelings which
grew up, and the movements that were fostered till they rendered
the Civil War inevitable, received something of the same impulse
from Massachusetts which she had given a century before to
the feelings and movements forerunning the War of American
Independence. When the war broke out it was her troops
who first received hostile fire in Baltimore, and turning their
mechanical training to account opened the obstructed railroad
to Washington. In the war thus begun she built, equipped
and manned many vessels for the Federal navy, and furnished
from 1861 to 1865 26,163 (or, including final credits, probably
more than 30,000) men for the navy. During the war all but
twelve small townships raised troops in excess of every call, the
excess throughout the state amounting in all to more than
15,000 men; while the total recruits to the Federal army (including
re-enlistments) numbered, according to the adjutant-general
of the state, 159,165 men, of which less than 7000 were
raised by draft.<a name="fa23r" id="fa23r" href="#ft23r"><span class="sp">23</span></a> The state, as such, and the townships spent
$42,605,517.19 in the war; and private contributions of citizens
are reckoned in addition at about $9,000,000, exclusive of
the aid to families of soldiers, paid then and later by the
state.</p>

<p>Since the close of the war Massachusetts has remained generally
steadfast in adherence to the principles of the Republican
party, and has continued to develop its resources. Navigation,
which was formerly the distinctive feature of its business
prosperity, has under the pressure of laws and circumstances
given place to manufactures, and the development of carrying
facilities on the land rather than on the sea.</p>

<p>In the Spanish-American War of 1898 Massachusetts furnished
11,780 soldiers and sailors, though her quota was but 7388;
supplementing from her own treasury the pay accorded them
by the national government.</p>

<p>No statement of the influence which Massachusetts has
exerted upon the American people, through intellectual activity,
and even through vagary, is complete without an enumeration
of the names which, to Americans at least, are the signs of this
influence and activity. In science the state can boast of John
Winthrop, the most eminent of colonial scientists; Benjamin
Thompson (Count Rumford); Nathaniel Bowditch, the translator
of Laplace; Benjamin Peirce and Morse the electrician;
not to include an adopted citizen in Louis Agassiz. In history,
Winthrop and Bradford laid the foundations of her story in
the very beginning; but the best example of the colonial period
is Thomas Hutchinson, and in later days Bancroft, Sparks,
Palfrey, Prescott, Motley and Parkman. In poetry, a pioneer
of the modern spirit in American verse was Richard Henry
Dana; and later came Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell
and Holmes. In philosophy and the science of living, Jonathan
Edwards, Franklin, Channing, Emerson and Theodore Parker.
In education, Horace Mann; in philanthropy, S. G. Howe.
In oratory, James Otis, Fisher Ames, Josiah Quincy, junr.,
Webster, Choate, Everett, Sumner, Winthrop and Wendell
Phillips; and, in addition, in statesmanship, Samuel Adams,
John Adams and John Quincy Adams. In fiction, Hawthorne
and Mrs Stowe. In law, Story, Parsons and Shaw. In scholarship,
Ticknor, William M. Hunt, Horatio Greenough, W. W.
Story and Thomas Ball. The &ldquo;transcendental movement,&rdquo;
which sprang out of German affiliations and produced as one
of its results the well-known community of Brook Farm (1841-1847),
under the leadership of Dr George Ripley, was a Massachusetts
growth, and in passing away it left, instead of traces
of an organization, a sentiment and an aspiration for higher
thinking which gave Emerson his following. When Massachusetts
was called upon to select for Statuary Hall in the
capitol at Washington two figures from the long line of her
worthies, she chose as her fittest representatives John Winthrop,
the type of Puritanism and state-builder, and Samuel Adams
(though here the choice was difficult between Samuel Adams
and John Adams) as her greatest leader in the heroic period
of the War of Independence.</p>

general history was that of J. G. Palfrey, <i>History of New
England</i> (5 vols., Boston, 1858-1890), to the War of Independence.
It is generally accurate in facts but written in an unsatisfactorily
eulogistic vein. Of importance in more modern views is a volume
of <i>Lectures Delivered ... before the Lowell Institute ... by Members
of the Massachusetts Historical Society on Subjects Relating to the
Early History of Massachusetts</i> (Boston, 1869), perhaps especially
the lectures of G. E. Ellis, later expanded, and in the process somewhat
weakened, into his <i>Puritan Age and Rule in the Colony of the
Massachusetts Bay, 1629-1685</i> (Boston, 1888; 3rd ed., 1891). See

Historical Review</i> (Oct., 1905). On New England discontent preceding
1812, Henry Adams, <i>Documents Relating to New England
Federalism, 1780-1815</i> (Boston, 1877); T. W. Higginson, <i>Massachusetts
in the Army and Navy during the War of 1861-65</i> (Official,
Boston, 2 vols., 1896). For a list of the historical societies of the
state consult A. M. Davis in <i>Publications</i> of the Colonial Society of
Massachusetts, vol. i.; the most important are the Massachusetts Historical
Society, established 1791, publishing <i>Collections and Proceedings</i>
(Boston) and the American Antiquarian Society, established
1812, publishing <i>Proceedings</i> (Worcester). In many cases the most
valuable material on various periods is indicated under the biographies
(or autobiographies in some cases) of the public men named in the
above article, to which add Timothy Pickering, George Cabot,
Joseph Warren, Elbridge Gerry, Benjamin F. Butler, G. S. Boutwell
and George F. Hoar. Many townships have published their local records,
and many township and county histories contain valuable
matter of general interest (<i>e.g.</i> as showing in detail township action
before the War of Independence), though generally weighted heavily
with genealogy and matters of merely local interest. In American
works of fiction, particularly of New England authors, the reader
will find a wealth of description of Massachusetts and New England
life, past and present, as in the writings of William D. Howells, Sarah
O. Jewett, Mary E. Wilkins-Freeman, Harriet B. Stowe and others.</p>

18.6, 21.0, 19.8, 15.6, 18.6, 18.6, 18.6, 17.4 and 17.4; the ratio of
marriages to the marriageable population was for males (above 16
years) 61.5, for females (above 14) 46.0; the fecundity of marriages
seemed to have increased, being about twice as high for foreigners
as for natives. See <i>Annual Report</i> of the Board of Health (1896),

<p><a name="ft17r" id="ft17r" href="#fa17r"><span class="fn">17</span></a> Boston remained a township, governed by town-meetings, until
1822, when it had a population of some 47,000. The government
of Brookline (pop. in 1905, 23,436) is an interesting example of the
adaptation of the township system to urban conditions. The town
is frequently referred to as a model residential suburb; its budgets
are very large, its schools are excellent, and, among other things,
it has established a township gymnasium. The town hall is not
large enough for an assemblage of all the voters, but actually the
attendance is usually limited to about 200, and since 1901 there
has been in force a kind of referendum, under which any measure
passed by a town-meeting attended by 700 or more voters may be
referred, upon petition of 100 legal voters, to a regular vote at the
polls. Much of the work of the town-meetings is done through
special committees.</p>

<p><a name="ft20r" id="ft20r" href="#fa20r"><span class="fn">20</span></a> In 1869 the personalty valuation was 60% that of realty; but
it steadily fell thereafter, amounting in 1893 to 32%. From 1874-1882
the assessment of realty increased nearly twelve times as
much as personalty. In the intervening period the assessed valuation
of realty in Boston increased more than 100%, while that of
personalty slightly diminished (the corresponding figures for the
entire United States from 1860 to 1890 being 172% and 12%), yet
the most competent business and expert opinions regarded the true
value of personalty as at least equal to and most likely twice as
great as that of realty.</p>

<p><a name="ft22r" id="ft22r" href="#fa22r"><span class="fn">22</span></a> Slavery had existed as a social fact from the earliest years, and
legally after 1641; but it was never profitable, and was virtually
abolished long before the War of American Independence; still it
was never abolished explicitly by Massachusetts, though the slave
trade was prohibited in 1788, and though a number of negroes were
declared free after the adoption of the constitution of 1780 on
the strength of the sweeping declaration of human rights in that
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSACRE,<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> a wholesale indiscriminate killing of persons,
and also, in a transferred sense, of animals. The word is adopted
from the French; but its origin is obscure. The meaning and
the old form <i>macecle</i> seem to point to it being a corruption
of the Lat. <i>macellum</i>, butcher&rsquo;s shop or shambles, hence meat
market; this is probably from the root <i>mac</i>-, seen in <span class="grk" title="machesthai">&#956;&#940;&#967;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>,
to fight, <span class="grk" title="machaira">&#956;&#940;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#945;</span>, sword, and Lat. <i>mactare</i>, to sacrifice. Another
derivation connects with the Old Low Ger. <i>matsken</i>, to cut in
pieces; cf. mod. Ger. <i>metzeln</i>, to massacre.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSAGE.<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> The word <i>massage</i> has of late years come into
general use to signify the method of treating disease or other
physical conditions by manipulating the muscles and joints.
According to Littré the word is derived from the Arabic <i>mass</i>,
and has the specific meaning of &ldquo;pressing the muscular parts
of the body with the hands, and exercising traction on the
joints in order to give suppleness and stimulate vitality.&rdquo;
It was probably adopted from the Arabian physicians by the
French, who have played a leading part in reviving this method
of treatment, which has been practised from time immemorial,
and by the most primitive people, but has from time to time
fallen into disuse among Western nations. In the <i>Odyssey</i>
the women are described as rubbing and kneading the heroes
on their return from battle. In India, under the name &ldquo;shampoo&rdquo;
(<i>tsh&#257;mpu&#257;</i>), the same process has formed part of the
native system of medicine from the most remote times; professional
massers were employed there by Alexander the Great
in 327 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In China the method is also of great antiquity,
and practised by a professional class; the Swedish gymnastic
system instituted by Pehr Henrik Ling is derived from the
book of Cong-Fou, the bonze of Tao-Sse. Hippocrates describes
and enjoins the use of manipulation, especially in cases of
stiff joints, and he was followed by other Greek physicians.
Oribasius gives an account of the application of friction with
the bare hands, which exactly corresponds with the modern
practice of massage. It is worthy of note that the treatment,
after being held in high esteem by the leading Greek physicians,
fell into disrepute with the profession, apparently on account
of its association with vicious abuses. The same drawback
has made itself felt in the present day, and can only be met
by the most scrupulous care in the choice of agents and the
manner of their employment. Among the Greeks, Romans,
Egyptians, and later the Turks, massage came to be part
of the ordinary procedure of the bath without any special
therapeutic intention, and the usage has survived until to-day;
but that mode of application was no doubt a refinement of
civilized life. Medical rubbing is older and more elementary
than bathing, as we see from its employment by savages. Probably
it was evolved independently among different races
from the natural instinct&mdash;shared by the lower animals&mdash;which
teaches to rub, press or lick any part of the body in which
uneasiness is felt, and is therefore the oldest of all therapeutic
means.</p>

<p>According to Weiss, the therapeutic use of massage was
revived in Europe by Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente
(1537-1619), who applied it to stiff joints and similar conditions.
Paracelsus in his <i>De medicina Aegyptiorum</i> (1591), gives a
description of methodical massage as practised by the Egyptians
quite on modern lines. Thereafter it appears to have been
adopted here and there by individual practitioners, and various
references are made to it, especially by French writers. The
word &ldquo;massage&rdquo; occurs in an essay written by Pierre Adolphe
Piorry (1794-1879) for a large encyclopaedia which appeared
in 1818, but it was probably used before. The practice was
gradually advocated by an increasing number of medical men.
In Great Britain it was called &ldquo;medical rubbing,&rdquo; and at
Edinburgh Beveridge had a staff of eight trained male rubbers.
A book published by Estradère in 1863 attracted much attention,
but the man who contributed most to the modern popularity
of massage was Metzger of Amsterdam, who began to use it
tentatively in 1853, and then proceeded to study and apply it
methodically. He published an essay on the subject in 1868.
The modern refinements of the treatment are chiefly due to him.
At the same time, its application by Dr Silas Weir Mitchell
to hysterical and other nervous conditions, in conjunction
with the &ldquo;rest cure,&rdquo; has done much to make it known.</p>

<p>Massage, as now practised, includes several processes, some
of which are passive and others active. The former are carried
out by an operator, and consist of rubbing and kneading
the skin and deeper tissues with the hands, and exercising
the joints by bending the patient&rsquo;s limbs. The active movements
consist of a special form of gymnastics, designed to
exercise particular muscles or groups of muscles. In what is
called &ldquo;Swedish massage&rdquo; the operator moves the limbs while
the patient resists, thus bringing the opposing muscles into play.
Some writers insist on confining the word &ldquo;massage&rdquo; to the
rubbing processes, and use the general term &ldquo;manipulation&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page864" id="page864"></a>864</span>
to cover all the movements mentioned; but this is a verbal
subtlety of no importance. It is evident that alike among the
Greeks, the Orientals, and savage races, the two processes have
always been applied as part of the same treatment, and the
definition quoted above from Littré goes to show that the word
&ldquo;massage&rdquo; is properly applied to both.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Rubbing has been subdivided into several processes, namely (1)
stroking, (2) kneading, (3) rubbing, and (4) tapping, and some
practitioners attach great importance to the application of a
particular process in a particular way. As a rule, oils and other
lubricants are not used. But, however it may be applied, the treatment
acts essentially by increasing circulation and improving
nutrition. It has been shown by Lauder Brunton that more blood
actually flows through the tissues during and after rubbing. The
number of red corpuscles, and, to some extent, their haemoglobin
value, are also said to be increased (Mitchell). At the same time the
movement of the lymph stream is accelerated. In order to assist
the flow of blood and lymph, stroking is applied centripetally,
that is to say, upwards along the limbs and the lower part of the
body, downwards from the head. The effects of the increased
physiological activity set up are numerous. Functional ability is
restored to exhausted muscles by the removal of fatigue products
and the induction of a fresh blood supply; congestion is relieved;
collections of serous fluid are dispersed; secretion and excretion are
stimulated; local and general nutrition are improved. These
effects indicate the conditions in which massage may be usefully
applied. Such are various forms of paralysis and muscular wasting,
chronic and subacute affections of the joints, muscular rheumatism,
sciatica and other neuralgias, local congestions, sprains, contractions,
insomnia and some forms of headache, in which downward stroking
from the head relieves cerebral congestion. It has also been used
in anaemia, hysteria and &ldquo;neurasthenia,&rdquo; disorders of the female
organs, melancholia and other forms of insanity, morphinism,
obesity, constipation, inflammatory and other affections of the eye,
including even cataract. General massage is sometimes applied,
as a form of passive exercise, to indolent persons whose tissues are
overloaded with the products of incomplete metabolism.</p>

<p>As with other methods of treatment, there has been a tendency
on the part of some practitioners to exalt it into a cure-all, and of
others to ignore it altogether. Of its therapeutic value, when
judiciously used, there is no doubt, but it is for the physician or
surgeon to say when and how it should be applied. Affections
to which it is not applicable are fevers, pregnancy, collections of
pus, acute inflammation of the joints, inflamed veins, fragile arteries,
wounds of the skin and, generally speaking, those conditions in which
it is not desirable to increase the circulation, or in which the patient
cannot bear handling. In such conditions it may have a very injurious
and even dangerous effect, and therefore should not be used
in a haphazard manner without competent advice.</p>

<p>The revival of massage in Europe and America has called into
existence a considerable number of professional operators, both
male and female, who may be regarded as forming a branch of the
nursing profession. Some of these are trained in hospitals or other
institutions, some by private practitioners and some not at all.
Similarly some are attached to organized societies or institutions
while others pursue their calling independently. Several things are
required for a good operator. One is physical strength. Deep
massage is very laborious work, and cannot be carried on for an
hour, or even half an hour, without unusual muscular power. Feeble
persons cannot practise it effectively at all. The duration of a sitting
may vary from five or ten minutes to an hour. For general massage
at least half an hour is required. A masser should have strength
enough to do the work without too obvious exhaustion, which gives
the patient an unpleasant impression. A second requirement is
tactile and muscular sensibility. A person not endowed with a fine
sense of touch and resistance is liable to exert too great or too little
pressure; the one hurts the patient, the other is ineffective. Then
skill and knowledge, which can only be acquired by a course of
instruction, are necessary. Finally, some guarantee of cleanliness
and character is almost indispensable. Independent massers may
possess all these qualifications in a higher degree than those connected
with an institution, but they may also be totally devoid of
them, whereas connexion with a recognized hospital or society is a
guarantee for a certain standard of efficiency. In London there are
several such institutions, which train and send out both male and
female massers. The fee is 5s. an hour, or from two to four guineas
a week. On the European continent, where trained massers are
much employed by some practitioners, the fee is considerably lower;
in the United States it is higher. For reasons mentioned above,
it is most desirable that patients should be attended by operators
of their own sex. If this is not insisted upon, a valuable therapeutic
means will be in danger of falling into disrepute both with the medical
profession and the general public.</p>

It was against their queen Tomyris that Cyrus undertook the

In their usages some tribes were nomads like the people of

savages. Probably the name denoted no ethnic unity, but
included all the barbarous north-eastern neighbours of the
Persians. Herodotus says they only used gold and copper

caused certain massive ornaments from southern Siberia,

<p><span class="bold">MASSAWA,<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Massowah</span>, a fortified town on the African
coast of the Red Sea, chief port of the Italian colony of Eritrea,
in 15° 36&prime; N. and 39° 28&prime; E. Pop. about 10,000. The town
stands at the north end of the bay of Massawa and is built
partly on a coral island of the same name&mdash;where was the
original settlement&mdash;and partly on the islets of Tautlub and
Sheik Said, and the neighbouring mainland. Massawa Island is
from 20 to 25 ft. above the sea, its length does not exceed ½ m.
and its breadth is about ¼ m. The harbour is formed by
the channel between the island and the mainland. It affords
good anchorage in from 5 to 9 fathoms. The town possesses
several good public buildings, chiefly built of coral,
as are the houses of the principal European and Arab merchants.
Landward the town is guarded by forts erected by the Italians
since 1885. Water was formerly scarce; but in 1872 an ancient
aqueduct from Mokullu (5 m. distant westward) was restored
and continued by an embankment to the town. A railway
connects Massawa with Asmara, the capital of the colony.
Besides the Abyssinians, who speak a Tigré dialect corrupted
with Arabic, the inhabitants comprise Italian officials and
traders, Greeks, Indians, Arabs from Yemen and Hadramut,
Gallas and Somalis. Massawa is the natural port for northern
Abyssinia but commerce is undeveloped owing to the lack of
rapid means of communication. The trade done consists
mainly in exporting hides, butter, Abyssinian coffee and civet,
and importing European and Indian cotton goods and silks.
It increased in value from about £65,000 per annum in 1865
(the last year of Turkish control) to from £240,000 to £280,000
between 1879 and 1881, when under the administration of
Egypt. Under the Italians trade greatly developed. The
returns for the five years 1901-1905 showed an average annual
value of £1,800,000, about two-thirds being imports.</p>

<p>The island of Massawa has probably been inhabited from
a very early date. It appears to have formed part of the
Abyssinian dominions for many centuries. It was at Massawa
(Matzua, as it is called by the Portuguese chroniclers) that
Christopher da Gama and his comrades landed in July 1541 on
their way to aid the Abyssinians against the Moslem invaders.
Captured by the Turks in 1557, the island remained a Turkish
possession over two hundred years. A military colony of
Bosnians settled at Arkiko (a port on the bay 4 m. south of
Massawa Island) was appointed not only to defend it in case
of attack from the mainland, but to keep it supplied with water
in return for $1400 per month from the town&rsquo;s customs. For
some time at the close of the 18th century Massawa was held
by the sherif of Mecca, and it afterwards passed to Mehemet Ali
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page865" id="page865"></a>865</span>
of Egypt. The Turks were reinstated about 1850, but in 1865
they handed the island back to Egypt for an annual tribute of
2½ million piastres. In February 1885 Massawa was occupied
by an Italian force, the Egyptian garrison stationed there
being withdrawn in the November following (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Egypt</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abyssinia</a></span>). The port was the capital of the Italian colony
until 1900 when the seat of administration was removed to
Asmara (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Eritrea</a></span>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For a description of the town in 1769 see the <i>Travels</i> of James
Bruce. At that time the governor, though appointed by the Turks,
paid one half of the customs receipts to the negus of Abyssinia in
return for the protection of that monarch.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSÉNA, ANDRÉ,<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> or <i>Andrea</i>, duke of Rivoli, prince of
Essling (1756-1817), the greatest of Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals,
son of a small wine merchant, it is said of Jewish origin, was
born at Nice on the 6th of May 1756. His parents were very
poor, and he began life as a cabin boy, but he did not care
much for the sea, and in 1775 he enlisted in the Royal-Italien
regiment. He quickly rose to be under-officer-adjutant; but,
finding his birth would prevent his ever getting a commission,
he left the army in 1789, retired to his native city,
and married. At the sound of war, however, and the word
republic, his desire to see service increased, and he once more
left Italy, and joined the 3rd battalion of the volunteers of the
Var in 1791. In those days when men elected their officers,
and many of the old commissioned officers had emigrated,
promotion to a man with a knowledge of his drill was rapid,
and by February 1792 Masséna was a lieutenant-colonel. His
regiment was one of those in the army which occupied Nice,
and in the advance to the Apennines which followed, his knowledge
of the country, of the language, and of the people was
so useful that in December 1793 he was already a general of
division. In command of the advanced guard he won the
battle of Saorgio in August 1794, capturing ninety guns, and
after many successes he at last, on the 23rd of November 1795,
with the right wing of the army of Italy, had the greatest share
in the victory of Loano, won by Schérer over the Austrians
and Sardinians. In Bonaparte&rsquo;s great campaign of 1796-97
Masséna was his most trusted general of division; in each battle
he won fresh laurels, up to the crowning victory of Rivoli,
from which he afterwards took his title. It was during this
campaign that Bonaparte gave him the title of <i>enfant gâté de
la victoire</i>, which he was to justify till he met the English in
1810. In 1798 he commanded the army of Rome for a short
time, but was displaced by the intrigues of his subordinate
Berthier. Masséna&rsquo;s next important service was in command
of the army in Switzerland, which united the army in Germany
under Moreau, and that in Italy under Joubert. There he
proved himself a great captain, as he had already proved himself
a great lieutenant; the archduke Charles and Suvarov had
each been successful in Germany and in Italy, and now turned
upon Masséna in Switzerland. That general held his ground
well against the archduke, and then suddenly, leaving Soult to
face the Austrians, he transported his army to Zürich, where,
on the 26th of September 1799, he entirely defeated Korsakov,
taking 200 guns and 5000 prisoners. This campaign and
battle placed his reputation on a level with that of his compatriot
Bonaparte, and he might have made the revolution
of Brumaire, but he was sincerely attached to the republic,
and had no ambition beyond a desire to live well and to have
plenty of money to spend. Bonaparte, now First Consul, sent
him to Genoa to command the débris of the army of Italy,
and he nobly defended Genoa from February to June to the
very last extremity, giving time for Bonaparte to strike his
great blow at Marengo. He now went to Paris, where he sat
in the Corps Législatif in 1803, and actually defended Moreau
without drawing upon himself the ill-will of Napoleon, who
well knew his honesty and lack of ambition.</p>

<p>In 1804 he was made one of the first marshals of France of
the new régime, and in 1805 was decorated with the Grand Eagle
of the Legion of Honour. In that year Napoleon needed an able
general to keep in check the archduke Charles in Italy, while he
advanced through Germany with the grand army. Masséna was
chosen; he kept the archduke occupied till he received news of
the surrender of Ulm, and then on the 30th of October defeated
him in the battle of Caldiero. After the peace of Pressburg had
been signed, Masséna was ordered to take possession of the
kingdom of Naples, and to place Joseph Bonaparte on the throne.
This task done, Napoleon summoned Masséna to Poland, where
he as usual distinguished himself, and where he for the time gave
up his republican principles. In 1808 he was made duke of
Rivoli. In 1808 he was accidentally wounded by his old enemy
Berthier when both were in attendance on the emperor at a
shooting party, and he lost the sight of one eye. In the campaign
in 1809 he covered himself with glory at Landshut and at
Eckmühl, and finally at the battle of Aspern-Essling his magnificent
leadership made what would without him have been an
appalling disaster into a mere reverse of which the enemy could
make no use. On the field of Wagram Masséna, though too ill
to ride, directed from his carriage the movements of the right
wing. For his great services he was created prince of Essling,
and given the princely castle of Thouars. He was then ordered
to Spain to &ldquo;drive the English into the sea.&rdquo; (For the campaigns
of 1810 and 1811, the advance to and the retreat from Torres
Vedras see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peninsular War</a></span>.) Masséna himself, with some
justice, ascribed his failure to the frequent disobedience of his
subordinates Ney, Reynier and Junot, and public opinion
attributed this disobedience to the presence with the army of
Masséna&rsquo;s mistress, and to the resentment thereat felt by the
wives of the three generals. Still, unsuccessful as he was,
Masséna displayed the determination of the defence of Genoa
and the fertility in expedients of the campaign of Zürich, and
kept his army for five weary months close up to Wellington&rsquo;s
impregnable position before retiring. His retreat through a
devastated country was terrible, but his force of character kept
his men together, and Ney having shown the worst side of his
character now showed the best in the frequent and brilliant rearguard
actions, until a new act of insubordination at last made the
old marshal dismiss Ney from his command. Soon Masséna
was once again ready to try his fortune, and he nearly defeated
Wellington at Fuentes d&rsquo;Oñoro, though much hampered by
Bessières. But his recall soon followed this and he returned
home to find his prestige gone. The old marshal felt he had a
right to complain of Ney and of Napoleon himself, and, it is said,
opened communications with Fouché and the remnant of the
republican party. Whether this be true or not, Napoleon gave
his greatest marshal no more employment in the field, but made
him merely a territorial commandant at Marseilles. This command
he still held at the restoration, when Louis XVIII. confirmed
him in it, and with true Bourbon stupidity gave him letters
of naturalization, as if the great leader of the French armies had
not ceased to be an Italian. When Napoleon returned from
Elba, Masséna, probably by the advice of Fouché, kept Marseilles
quiet to await events, the greatest service he could do the royalists,
but afterwards imputed to him as a fault. After the second
restoration Masséna was summoned to sit on the court-martial
which tried Marshal Ney, but, though he had been on bad terms
with that general, and attributed his own disgrace to him, the
old soldier would not be his comrade&rsquo;s judge. This refusal was
used by the royalists to attack the marshal, against whom they
raked up every offence they could think of. This annoyance
shortened his life, and on the 4th of April 1817 the old hero died.
He was buried in Père-la-Chaise, with only the word &ldquo;Masséna&rdquo;
upon his tombstone.</p>

<p>In private life indolent, greedy, rapacious, ill-educated and
morose, in war Masséna was, like Napoleon, the incarnation of
battle. Only his indolence and his consequent lack of far-ranging
imagination prevented him being as great in strategy as
in tactics. His genius needed the presence of the enemy to stimulate
it, but once it sprang to life Masséna became an ideal leader,
absolutely brave, resourceful, unrelenting and indefatigable.
He was as great a master of the strategy of forces in immediate
contact&mdash;of gathering up as it were the threads of the fugue into
a &ldquo;stretto.&rdquo; For the planning of a whole perfect campaign he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page866" id="page866"></a>866</span>
had neither knowledge nor inclination, and he falls short therefore
of the highest rank amongst great generals; but his place
amongst the greatest of soldiers is beyond challenge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSENBACH, CHRISTIAN KARL AUGUST LUDWIG VON<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span>
(1758-1827), Prussian soldier, was born at Schmalkalden on
the 16th of April 1758, and educated at Heilbronn and Stuttgart,
devoting himself chiefly to mathematics. He became an officer
of the Württemberg army in 1778, and left this for the service of
Frederick the Great in 1782. The pay of his rank was small, and
his appointment on the quartermaster-general&rsquo;s staff made it
necessary to keep two horses, so that he had to write mathematical
school-books in his spare time to eke out his resources.
He was far however from neglecting the science and art of war,
for thus early he had begun to make his name as a theorist as
well as a mathematician. After serving as instructor in mathematics
to the young prince Louis, he took part with credit in the
expedition into Holland, and was given the order <i>Pour le mérite</i>.
On returning to Prussia he became mathematical instructor at
the school of military engineering, leaving this post in 1792 to
take part as a general staff officer in the war against France.
He was awarded a prebend at Minden for his services as a topographical
engineer on the day of Valmy, and after serving through
the campaigns of 1793 and 1794 he published a number of
memoirs on the military history of these years. He was chiefly
occupied however with framing schemes for the reorganization of
the then neglected general staff of the Prussian army, and many
of his proposals were accepted. Bronsart von Schellendorf in
his <i>Duties of the General Staff</i> says of Massenbach&rsquo;s work in this
connexion, &ldquo;the organization which he proposed and in the
main carried out survived even the catastrophes of 1806-1807,
and exists even at the present moment in its original
outline.&rdquo; This must be accounted as high praise when it is
remembered how much of the responsibility for these very
disasters must be laid to Massenbach&rsquo;s account. The permanent
gain to the service due to his exertions was far more than formal,
for it is to him that the general staff owes its tradition of thorough
and patient individual effort. But the actual doctrine taught
by Massenbach, who was now a colonel, may be summarized as
the doctrine of positions carried to a ludicrous excess; the claims
put forward for the general staff, that it was to prepare cut-and-dried
plans of operations in peace which were to be imposed on
the troop leaders in war, were derided by the responsible generals;
and the memoirs on proposed plans of campaign to suit certain
political combinations were worked out in quite unnecessary
detail. It was noteworthy that none of the proposed plans of
campaign considered France as an enemy.</p>

<p>In 1805 came threats of the war with Napoleon which Massenbach
had strongly opposed. He was made quartermaster-general
(chief of staff) to Prince Hohenlohe, over whom he soon
obtained a fatal ascendancy. War was averted for a moment
by the result of the battle of Austerlitz, but it broke out in earnest
in October 1806. Massenbach&rsquo;s influence clouded all the
Prussian operations. The battles of Jena and Auerstädt were
lost, and the capitulation of Prince Hohenlohe&rsquo;s army was
negotiated. Even suggestions of disloyalty were not wanting;
an attempt to try him by court-martial was only frustrated by
Prince Hohenlohe&rsquo;s action in taking upon himself, as commander-in-chief,
the whole responsibility for Massenbach&rsquo;s actions. He
then retired to his estate in the Posen province, and occupied
himself in writing pamphlets, memoirs, &amp;c. When his estates
passed into the grand duchy of Warsaw, he chose to remain a
Prussian subject, and on the outbreak of the war of liberation he
asked in vain for a post on the Prussian staff. After the fall of
Napoleon he took part in Württemberg politics, was expelled
from Stuttgart and Heidelberg, and soon afterwards arrested at
Frankfurt, delivered over to the Prussian authorities and condemned
to fourteen years&rsquo; fortress imprisonment for his alleged
publication of state secrets in his memoirs. He was kept in
prison till 1826, when Frederick William III., having recovered
from an accident, pardoned those whom he considered to have
wronged him most deeply. He died on the 21st of November
1827, at his estate of Bialokoscz, Posen.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSENET, JULES ÉMILE FRÉDÉRIC<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1842-&emsp;&emsp;), French
composer, was born at Montaud, on the 12th of May 1842. He
studied at the Paris Conservatoire, where he obtained the Grand
Prix de Rome in 1863 with the cantata <i>David Rizzio</i>. Massenet
became one of the most prolific composers of his time. His
operas include the following: <i>La Grande tante</i>, one act, opéra
comique (1867); <i>Don César de Bazan</i>, three acts, opéra comique
(1872); <i>Le Roi de Lahore</i>, five acts, opera (1877); <i>Hérodiade</i>, five
acts (Brussels, 1881); <i>Manon</i>, five acts, opéra comique (1884);
<i>Le Cid</i>, four acts, opera (1885); <i>Esclarmonde</i>, four acts, opéra
comique (1889); <i>Le Mage</i>, five acts, opera (1891); <i>Werther</i>, four
acts (Vienna, 1892); <i>Thaïs</i>, three acts, opera (1894); <i>Le Portrait
de Manon</i>, one act, opéra comique (1894); <i>La Navarraise</i>,
two acts (Covent Garden, 1894); <i>Sapho</i>, opéra comique (1897);
<i>Cendrillon</i>, opéra comique (1900); <i>Grisélidis</i>, opéra comique
(1901); <i>Le Jongleur de Notre Dame</i> (Mentone, 1902). Of these the
most popular is Manon. Massenet&rsquo;s other works include <i>Marie
Madeleine</i>, sacred drama (1873); <i>Eve</i>, a mystery (1875); <i>La Vierge</i>,
sacred legend (1880); six orchestral suites entitled <i>Scènes hongroises</i>,
<i>Scènes pittoresques</i>, <i>Scènes dramatiques</i>, <i>Scènes napolitaines</i>,
<i>Scènes de féerie</i>, <i>Scènes alsaciennes</i>; music to the tragedy
<i>Les Erynnies</i>, to <i>Théodora</i>, <i>Le Crocodile</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Hetman</i>; a requiem,
<i>Narcisse</i>; an idyll, <i>Biblis</i>; a <i>Scène antique</i>; several sets of
songs, entitled <i>Poème d&rsquo;avril</i>, <i>Poème d&rsquo;amour</i>, <i>Poème d&rsquo;hiver</i>,
<i>Poème d&rsquo;octobre</i>, <i>Poème pastoral</i>, <i>Poème du souvenir</i>; also a
large number of detached songs. He was professor of composition
at the Conservatoire from 1878 to 1896, among his pupils being
Hillemacher, Marty, Bruneau, Vidal, Pierné, Leroux and Charpentier.
Massenet undoubtedly possesses a style of his own. He
is at his best in music descriptive of the tender passion, and
many of the love scenes in his operas are very beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSEREENE, JOHN CLOTWORTHY,<a name="ar145" id="ar145"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Viscount</span> (d.
1665), Anglo-Irish politician, was a son of Sir Hugh Clotworthy,
sheriff of county Antrim. He was elected to the Irish parliament
as member for county Antrim in 1634, and was a member both
of the Short and of the Long Parliament in England. Clotworthy
was a vehement opponent of the earl of Stafford, in whose
impeachment he took an active share. He also took part in the
prosecution of Archbishop Laud. Having unsuccessfully negotiated
with Ormond for the surrender of Dublin to the Parliamentary
forces in 1646, he was accused in the following year of
having betrayed his cause, and also of embezzlement; in consequence
of these charges he fled to the Continent, but returned
to parliament in June 1648. On the 12th of December in that
year he was arrested, and remained in prison for nearly three
years. Having taken an active part in forwarding the Restoration,
he was employed in Ireland in arranging the affairs of the
soldiers and other adventurers who had settled in Ireland
Clotworthy in no way abated his old animosity against &ldquo;papists&rdquo;
and high Anglicans, and he championed the cause of the Irish
Presbyterians; but being personally agreeable to Charles II.,
his ecclesiastical views were overlooked, and on the 21st of
November 1660 he was created Baron Loughneagh and Viscount
Massereene in the Irish peerage, with remainder in default of
male heirs to his son-in-law, Sir John Skeffington. Massereene
died without male issue in September 1665, and the title devolved
on Skeffington, whose great-grandson, the fifth viscount, was
created earl of Massereene in 1756. The earldom became
extinct on the death of the fourth earl without male issue in
1816, the viscounty and barony of Loughneagh descending to
his daughter Harriet, whose husband, Thomas Foster, took the
name of Skeffington, and inherited from his mother in 1824 the
titles of Viscount Ferrard and Baron Oriel of Collon in the Irish
peerage, and from his father in 1828 that of Baron Oriel of
Ferrard in the peerage of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSEY, SIR EDWARD<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1619-<i>c.</i> 1674), English soldier
in the Great Rebellion, was the son of John Massey of Coddington,
Cheshire. Little is known of his early life, but it is said that he
served in the Dutch army against the Spaniards. In 1639 he
appears as a captain of pioneers in the army raised by Charles I.
to fight against the Scots. At the outbreak of the Great Rebellion
he was with the king at York, but he soon joined the Parliamentary
army. As lieutenant-colonel under the earl of Stamford
he became deputy governor of Gloucester, where he remained
till towards the end of the first Civil War, becoming governor
early in 1643. He conducted minor operations against numerous
small bodies of Royalists, and conducted the defence of Gloucester
against the king&rsquo;s main army in August 1643, with great
steadiness and ability, receiving the thanks of parliament and a
grant of £1000 for his services. In 1644 Massey continued to
keep the field and to disperse the local Royalists, and on several
occasions he measured swords with Prince Rupert. In May 1644
he was made general of the forces of the Western Association.
In 1645 he took the offensive against Lord Goring and the
western Royalists, advanced to the relief of Taunton, and in the
autumn co-operated effectively with Sir Thomas Fairfax and the
New Model army in the Langport campaign. After taking part
in the desultory operations which closed the first war, he took
his seat in the House of Commons as member for Gloucester.
He then began to take an active part in politics on the Presbyterian
side, and was one of the generals who was impeached by
the army on the ground that they were attempting to revive
the Civil War in the Presbyterian interests. Massey fled from
England in June 1647, and though he resumed his seat in the
house in 1648 he was again excluded by Pride&rsquo;s Purge, and after
a short imprisonment escaped to Holland. Thence, taking the
side of the king openly and definitely like many other Presbyterians,
he accompanied Charles II. to Scotland. He fought
against Cromwell at the bridge of Stirling and Inverkeithing,
and commanded the advanced guard of the Royalist army in the
invasion of England in 1651. It was hoped that Massey&rsquo;s
influence would win over the towns of the Severn valley to the
cause of the king, and the march of the army on Worcester was
partly inspired by this expectation. However, he effected little,
and after riding with the king for some distance from the field
of Worcester, fell into the hands of his former comrades and was
lodged in the Tower. He again managed to escape to Holland.
While negotiating with the English Presbyterians for the restoration
of Charles, he visited England twice, in 1654 and 1656. In
1660 he was active in preparing for Charles&rsquo;s return, and was
rewarded by a knighthood and a grant of £3000. The rest of
his life was spent in political, and occasionally in military and
administrative business, and he is said to have died in Ireland in
1674 or 1675.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSEY, GERALD<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> (1828-1907), English poet, was born near
Tring, Hertfordshire, on the 29th of May 1828. His parents were
in humble circumstances, and Massey was little more than a
child when he was set to hard work in a silk factory, which he
afterwards deserted for the equally laborious occupation of straw-plaiting.
These early years were rendered gloomy by much
distress and deprivation, against which the young man strove
with increasing spirit and virility, educating himself in his spare
time, and gradually cultivating his innate taste for literary
work. He was attracted by the movement known as Christian
Socialism, into which he threw himself with whole-hearted vigour,
and so became associated with Maurice and Kingsley. His first
public appearance as a writer was in connexion with a journal
called the <i>Spirit of Freedom</i>, of which he became editor, and he
was only twenty-two when he published his first volume of poems,
<i>Voices of Freedom and Lyrics of Love</i>. These he followed in rapid
succession by <i>The Ballad of Babe Christabel</i> (1854), <i>War Waits</i>
(1855), <i>Havelock&rsquo;s March</i> (1860), and <i>A Tale of Eternity</i> (1869).
Many years afterwards in 1889, he collected the best of the
contents of these volumes, with additions, into a two-volume
edition of his poems called <i>My Lyrical Life</i>. He also published
works dealing with spiritualism, the study of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets (1872 and 1890), and theological speculation. It is
generally understood that he was the original of George Eliot&rsquo;s
<i>Felix Holt</i>. Massey&rsquo;s poetry has a certain rough and vigorous
element of sincerity and strength which easily accounts for its
popularity at the time of its production. He treated the theme
of Sir Richard Grenville before Tennyson thought of using it,
with much force and vitality. Indeed, Tennyson&rsquo;s own praise
of Massey&rsquo;s work is still its best eulogy, for the Laureate found
in him &ldquo;a poet of fine lyrical impulse, and of a rich half-Oriental
imagination.&rdquo; The inspiration of his poetry is essentially
British; he was a patriot to the core. It is, however, as an
Egyptologist that Gerald Massey is best known in the world
of letters. He first published <i>The Book of the Beginnings</i>,
followed by <i>The Natural Genesis</i>; but by far his most important
work is <i>Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World</i>, published
shortly before his death. He died on the 29th of October
1907.</p>

<p>It was very famous for its wine in ancient times. There was just

guarded by the Auruncan town of Vescia (probably on the mountain
side), which ceased to exist in 314 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> after the defeat of the Ausones,
but left its name to the spot. Its successor, Sinuessa, on the coast,
a station on the Via Appia, was constructed in 312 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and a colony
was founded there in 295 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It is not infrequently mentioned by
classical writers as a place in which travellers halted. Here Virgil
joined Horace on the famous journey to Brundusium. Domitian
considerably increased its importance by the construction of the
Via Domitiana, which left the Via Appia here and ran to Cumae
and Puteoli, and it was he, no doubt, who raised it to the position of
<i>colonia Flavia</i>. The town was destroyed by the Saracens, but some
ruins of it are still visible two miles north-west of the modern
village of Mondragone. The mineral springs which still rise here
were frequented in antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSILLON, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1663-1742), French bishop
and preacher, was born at Hyères on the 24th of June 1663, his
father being a royal notary of that town. At the age of eighteen
he joined the Congregation of the Oratory and taught for a time
in the colleges of his order at Pézenas, and Montbrison and at
the Seminary of Vienne. On the death of Henri de Villars,
archbishop of Vienne, in 1693, he was commissioned to deliver
a funeral oration, and this was the beginning of his fame. In
obedience to Cardinal de Noailles, archbishop of Paris, he left
the Cistercian abbey of Sept-Fonds, to which he had retired, and
settled in Paris, where he was placed at the head of the famous
seminary of Saint Magloire. He soon gained a wide reputation
as a preacher and was selected to be the Advent preacher at the
court of Versailles in 1699. He was made bishop of Clermont in
1717, and two years later was elected a member of the French
Academy. The last years of his life were spent in the faithful
discharge of his episcopal duties; his death took place at Clermont
on the 18th of September 1742. Massillon enjoyed in the 18th
century a reputation equal to that of Bossuet and of Bourdaloue,
and has been much praised by Voltaire, D&rsquo;Alembert and kindred
spirits among the <i>Encyclopaedists</i>. His popularity was probably
due to the fact that in his sermons he lays little stress on dogmatic
questions, but treats generally of moral subjects, in which
the secrets of the human heart and the processes of man&rsquo;s reason
are described with poetical feeling. He has usually been contrasted
with his predecessor Bourdaloue, the latter having the
credit of vigorous denunciation, Massillon that of gentle persuasiveness.
Besides the <i>Petit Carême</i>, a sermon which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page868" id="page868"></a>868</span>
delivered before the young king Louis XV. in 1718, his sermons
on the Prodigal Son, on the small number of the elect, on death,
for Christmas Day, and for the Fourth Sunday in Advent, may
be perhaps cited as his masterpieces. His funeral oration on
Louis XIV. is only noted now for the opening sentence: &ldquo;Dieu
seul est grand.&rdquo; But in truth Massillon is singularly free from
inequality. His great literary power, his reputation for
benevolence, and his known toleration and dislike of doctrinal
disputes caused him to be much more favourably regarded
than most churchmen by the <i>philosophes</i> of the 18th century.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first edition of Massillon&rsquo;s complete works was published by
his nephew, also an Oratorian (Paris, 1745-1748), and upon this,
in the absence of MSS., succeeding reprints were based. The best
modern edition is that of the Abbé Blampignon (Paris, 1865-1868,
4 vols.; new ed. 1886).</p>

antiquity, said to be descended from the ancient Maximi of
republican Rome. The name is first mentioned in 1012 in the
person of Leo de Maximis, and the family played a considerable
part in the history of the city in the middle ages. The brothers
Pietro and Francesco Massimi acquired fame by protecting and
encouraging the German printer Ulrich Hahn, who came to
Rome in 1467. In the 16th century the Massimi were the richest
of the Roman nobles. A marquisate was conferred on them in
1544, and the lordship of Arsoli in 1574. To-day there are two
branches of the Massimi, viz. the Principi Massimo, descended
from Camillo Massimiliano (1770-1840), and the dukes of
Rignano, descended from Francesco Massimo (1773-1844).
One of the sons of the present Prince Camillo Carlo Alberto, Don
Fabrizio, married Princess Beatrice, daughter of Don Carlos of

<p><span class="bold">MASSINGER, PHILIP<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> (1583-1640), English dramatist, son of
Arthur Massinger or Messanger, was baptized at St Thomas&rsquo;s,
Salisbury, on the 24th of November 1583. He apparently
belonged to an old Salisbury family, for the name occurs in the
city records as early as 1415. He is described in his matriculation
entry at St Alban Hall, Oxford (1602), as the son of a
gentleman. His father, who had also been educated at St Alban
Hall, was a member of parliament, and was attached to the household
of Henry Herbert, 2nd earl of Pembroke, who recommended
him in 1587 for the office of examiner in the court of the marches.
The 3rd earl of Pembroke, the William Herbert whose name has
been connected with Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, succeeded to the
title in 1601. It has been suggested that he supported the poet
at Oxford, but the significant omission of any reference to him
in any of Massinger&rsquo;s prefaces points to the contrary. Massinger
left Oxford without a degree in 1606. His father had died in
1603, and he was perhaps dependent on his own exertions. The
lack of a degree and the want of patronage from Lord Pembroke
may both be explained on the supposition that he had become
a Roman Catholic. On leaving the university he went to London
to make his living as a dramatist, but his name cannot be definitely
affixed to any play until fifteen years later, when <i>The Virgin
Martyr</i> (ent. at Stationers&rsquo; Hall, Dec. 7, 1621) appeared as the
work of Massinger and Dekker. During these years he worked
in collaboration with other dramatists. A joint letter, from
Nathaniel Field, Robert Daborne and Philip Massinger, to
Philip Henslowe, begs for an immediate loan of five pounds to
release them from their &ldquo;unfortunate extremitie,&rdquo; the money
to be taken from the balance due for the &ldquo;play of Mr Fletcher&rsquo;s
and ours.&rdquo; A second document shows that Massinger and Daborne
owed Henslowe £3 on the 4th of July 1615. The earlier note probably
dates from 1613, and from this time Massinger apparently
worked regularly with John Fletcher, although in editions of
Beaumont and Fletcher&rsquo;s works his co-operation is usually
unrecognized. Sir Aston Cokayne, Massinger&rsquo;s constant friend
and patron, refers in explicit terms to this collaboration in a
sonnet addressed to Humphrey Moseley on the publication of his
folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher (<i>Small Poems of Divers
Sorts</i>, 1658), and in an epitaph on the two poets he says:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Plays they did write together, were great friends,</p>
<p class="i05">And now one grave includes them in their ends.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">After Philip Henslowe&rsquo;s death in 1616 Massinger and Fletcher
began to write for the King&rsquo;s Men. Between 1623 and 1626
Massinger produced unaided for the Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s Men then
playing at the Cockpit three pieces, <i>The Parliament of Love</i>, <i>The
Bondman</i> and <i>The Renegado</i>. With the exception of these plays
and <i>The Great Duke of Florence</i>, produced in 1627 by the Queen&rsquo;s
servants, Massinger continued to write regularly for the King&rsquo;s
Men until his death. The tone of the dedications of his later
plays affords evidence of his continued poverty. Thus in the
preface to <i>The Maid of Honour</i> (1632) he wrote, addressing Sir
Francis Foljambe and Sir Thomas Bland: &ldquo;I had not to this
time subsisted, but that I was supported by your frequent
courtesies and favours.&rdquo; The prologue to <i>The Guardian</i>
(licensed 1633) refers to two unsuccessful plays and two years of
silence, when the author feared he had lost the popular favour.
S. R. Gardiner, in an essay on &ldquo;The Political Element in
Massinger&rdquo; (<i>Contemp. Review</i>, Aug. 1876), maintained that
Massinger&rsquo;s dramas are before all else political, that the events
of his day were as openly criticized in his plays as current
politics are in the cartoons of <i>Punch</i>. It is probable that this
break in his production was owing to his free handling of public
matters. In 1631 Sir Henry Herbert, the master of the revels,
refused to license an unnamed play by Massinger because of
&ldquo;dangerous matter as the deposing of Sebastian, King of
Portugal,&rdquo; calculated presumably to endanger good relations
between England and Spain. There is little doubt that this was
the same piece as <i>Believe as You List</i>, in which time and place
are changed, Antiochus being substituted for Sebastian, and
Rome for Spain. In the prologue Massinger ironically apologizes
for his ignorance of history, and professes that his accuracy is at
fault if his picture comes near &ldquo;a late and sad example.&rdquo; The
obvious &ldquo;late and sad example&rdquo; of a wandering prince could be
no other than Charles I.&rsquo;s brother-in-law, the elector palatine.
An allusion to the same subject may be traced in <i>The Maid of
Honour</i>. In another play by Massinger, not extant, Charles I.
is reported to have himself struck out a passage put into the
mouth of Don Pedro, king of Spain, as &ldquo;too insolent.&rdquo; The
poet seems to have adhered closely to the politics of his patron,
Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery, and afterwards 4th earl of
Pembroke, who had leanings to democracy and was a personal
enemy of the duke of Buckingham. In <i>The Bondman</i>, dealing
with the history of Timoleon, Buckingham is satirized as Gisco.
The servility towards the Crown displayed in Beaumont and
Fletcher&rsquo;s plays reflected the temper of the court of James I.
The attitude of Massinger&rsquo;s heroes and heroines towards kings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page869" id="page869"></a>869</span>
is very different. Camiola&rsquo;s remarks on the limitations of the
royal prerogative (<i>Maid of Honour</i>, act iv. sc. v.) could hardly be
acceptable at court.</p>

<p>Massinger died suddenly at his house near the Globe theatre,
and was buried in the churchyard of St Saviour&rsquo;s, Southwark, on
the 18th of March 1640. In the entry in the parish register he is
described as a &ldquo;stranger,&rdquo; which, however, implies nothing more
than that he belonged to another parish.</p>

<p>The supposition that Massinger was a Roman Catholic rests
upon three of his plays, <i>The Virgin Martyr</i> (licensed 1620), <i>The
Renegado</i> (licensed 1624) and <i>The Maid of Honour</i> (<i>c.</i> 1621).
The religious sentiment is certainly such as would obviously
best appeal to an audience sympathetic to Roman Catholic
doctrine. <i>The Virgin Martyr</i>, in which Dekker probably had a
large share, is really a miracle play, dealing with the martyrdom
of Dorothea in the time of Diocletian, and the supernatural
element is freely used. Little stress can be laid on this performance
as elucidating Massinger&rsquo;s views. It is not entirely
his work, and the story is early Christian, not Roman Catholic.
In <i>The Renegado</i>, however, the action is dominated by the
beneficent influence of a Jesuit priest, Francisco, and the doctrine
of baptismal regeneration is enforced. In <i>The Maid of Honour</i>
a complicated situation is solved by the decision of the heroine,
Camiola, to take the veil. For this she is held up &ldquo;to all posterity
a fair example for noble maids to imitate.&rdquo; Among all
Massinger&rsquo;s heroines Camiola is distinguished by genuine purity
and heroism.</p>

<p>His plays have generally an obvious moral intention. He sets
himself to work out a series of ethical problems through a succession
of ingenious and effective plots. In the art of construction
he has, indeed, few rivals. But the virtue of his heroes and
heroines is rather morbid than natural, and often singularly
divorced from common-sense. His <i>dramatis personae</i> are in
general types rather than living persons, and their actions do not
appear to spring inevitably from their characters, but rather
from the exigencies of the plot. The heroes are too good, and the
villains too wicked to be quite convincing. Moreover their
respective goodness and villainy are too often represented as
extraneous to themselves. This defect of characterization shows
that English drama had already begun to decline.</p>

<p>It seems doubtful whether Massinger was ever a popular playwright,
for the best qualities of his plays would appeal rather
to politicians and moralists than to the ordinary playgoer. He
contributed, however, at least one great and popular character
to the English stage. Sir Giles Overreach, in <i>A New Way to Pay
Old Debts</i>, is a sort of commercial Richard III., a compound of
the lion and the fox, and the part provides many opportunities
for a great actor. He made another considerable contribution
to the comedy of manners in <i>The City Madam</i>. In Massinger&rsquo;s
own judgment <i>The Roman Actor</i> was &ldquo;the most perfect birth of
his Minerva.&rdquo; It is a study of the tyrant Domitian, and of the
results of despotic rule on the despot himself and his court.
Other favourable examples of his grave and restrained art are
<i>The Duke of Milan</i>, <i>The Bondman</i> and <i>The Great Duke of
Florence</i>.</p>

<p>Massinger was a student and follower of Shakespeare. The
form of his verse, especially in the number of run-on lines,
approximates in some respects to Shakespeare&rsquo;s later manner.
He is rhetorical and picturesque, but rarely rises to extraordinary
felicity. His verse is never mean, but it sometimes comes perilously
near to prose, and in dealing with passionate situations it
lacks fire and directness.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The plays attributed to Massinger alone are: <i>The Duke of Milan,
a Tragedy</i> (<i>c.</i> 1618, pr. 1623 and 1638); <i>The Unnatural Combat, a
Tragedy</i> (<i>c.</i> 1619, pr. 1639); <i>The Bondman, an Antient Storie</i>
(licensed 1623, pr. 1624); <i>The Renegado, a Tragaecomedie</i> (lic. 1624,
pr. 1630); <i>The Parliament of Love</i> (lic. 1624; ascribed, no doubt
erroneously, in the Stationers&rsquo; Register, 1660, to W. Rowley; first
printed by Gifford from an imperfect MS. in 1805); <i>A New Way to
Pay Old Debts, a Comoedie</i> (<i>c.</i> 1625, pr. 1632); <i>The Roman Actor.
A Tragaedie</i> (lic. 1626, pr. 1629); <i>The Maid of Honour</i> (dating perhaps
from 1621, pr. 1632); <i>The Picture, a Tragecomedie</i> (lic. 1629, pr.
1630); <i>The Great Duke of Florence, a Comicall Historie</i> (lic. 1627,
pr. 1635); <i>The Emperor of the East, a Tragaecomoedie</i> (lic. and pr.
1631), founded on the story of Theodosius the Younger; <i>Believe as
You List</i> (rejected by the censor in January, but licensed in May,
1631; pr. 1848-1849 for the Percy Society); <i>The City Madam, a
Comedie</i> (lic. 1632, pr. 1658), which Mr Fleay (<i>Biog. Chron. of the Eng.
Drama</i>, i. 226), however, considers to be a <i>rifaciamento</i> of an older
play, probably by Jonson; <i>The Guardian</i> (lic. 1633, pr. 1655); and
<i>The Bashful Lover</i> (lic. 1636, pr. 1655). <i>A Very Woman, or The
Prince of Tarent</i>, licensed in 1634 as the work of Massinger alone, is
generally referred to his collaboration with Fletcher. The &ldquo;exquisite
temperance and justice&rdquo; of this piece are, according to Swinburne,
foreign to Fletcher&rsquo;s genius, and afford a striking example of
Massinger&rsquo;s artistic skill and moderation.</p>

<p>Twelve plays of Massinger are said to be lost, but the titles of
some of these may be duplicates of those of existing plays. Five of
these lost plays were MSS. used by John Warburton&rsquo;s cook for pie-covers.
The numerous plays in which Massinger&rsquo;s co-operation with
John Fletcher is generally assumed are dealt with under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beaumont
and Fletcher</a></span>. But it may be here noted that Mr R. Boyle has
constructed an ingenious case for the joint authorship by Fletcher
and Massinger of the two &ldquo;Shakespearian&rdquo; plays, <i>Henry VIII.</i> and
<i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i> (see the New Shakspere Society&rsquo;s <i>Transactions</i>,
1884 and 1882). Mr Boyle sees the touch of Massinger in the
first two acts of the <i>Second Maiden&rsquo;s Tragedy</i> (Lansdowne MS.,
lic. 1611), a play with which the names of Fletcher and Tourneur
are also associated by different critics. <i>The Fatall Dowry, a Tragedy</i>
(<i>c.</i> 1619, pr. 1632), which was adapted without acknowledgment by
Nicholas Rowe in his <i>Fair Penitent</i>, was written in conjunction with
Nathaniel Field; and <i>The Virgin Martir, a Tragedie</i> (lic. 1620, pr.
1621), with Thomas Dekker.</p>

<p>Massinger&rsquo;s independent works were collected by Coxeter (4 vols.,
1759, revised edition with introduction by Thomas Davies, 1779),
by J. Monck Mason (4 vols., 1779), by William Gifford (4 vols.,
1805, 1813), by Hartley Coleridge (1840), by Lieut.-Colonel Cunningham
(1867), and selections by Mr Arthur Symons in the <i>Mermaid
Series</i> (1887-1889). Gifford&rsquo;s remains the standard edition, and
formed the basis of Cunningham&rsquo;s text. It contains &ldquo;An Essay
on the Dramatic Writings of Massinger&rdquo; by Dr John Ferriar.</p>

<p>Massinger has been the object of a good deal of criticism. A
metrical examination of the plays in which Massinger was concerned
is given in <i>Englische Studien</i> (Halle, v. 74, vii. 66, viii. 39, ix. 209
and x. 383), by Mr R. Boyle, who also contributed the life of the
poet in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. The sources of his
plays are dealt with by E. Koeppel in <i>Quellen Studien zu den Dramen
Chapman&rsquo;s, Massinger&rsquo;s und Ford&rsquo;s</i> (Strassburg, 1897). For detailed
criticism, beside the introductions to the editions quoted, see A. W.
Ward, <i>Hist. of Eng. Dram. Lit.</i> (1899), iii. 1-47, and F. G. Fleay,
<i>Biog. Chron. of the Eng. Drama</i> (1891), under <i>Fletcher</i>; a general
estimate of Massinger, dealing especially with his moral standpoint,
is given in Sir Leslie Stephen&rsquo;s <i>Hours in a Library</i> (3rd series, 1879);
Swinburne, in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> (July 1889), while acknowledging
the justice of Sir L. Stephen&rsquo;s main strictures, found much to
say in praise of the poet.</p>

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MASSINISSA<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 238-149 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), king of Massylian or eastern
Numidia. He was educated, like many of the Numidian chiefs,
at Carthage, learnt Latin and Greek, and was an accomplished
as well as a naturally clever man. Although his kingdom was
nominally independent of Carthage, it really stood to it in a
relation of vassalage; it was directly under Carthaginian influences,
and was imbued to a very considerable extent with Carthaginian
civilization. It was to this that Massinissa owed his fame
and success; he was a barbarian at heart, but he had a varnish
of culture, and to this he added the craft and cunning in which
Carthaginian statesmen were supposed to excel. While yet a
young man (212) he forced his neighbour Syphax, prince of
western Numidia, who had recently entered into an alliance
with Rome, to fly to the Moors in the extreme west of Africa.
Soon afterwards he appeared in Spain, fighting for Carthage
with a large force of Numidian cavalry against the Romans
under the two Scipios. The defeat of the Carthaginian army in
206 led him to cast in his lot with Rome. Scipio Africanus is
said to have cultivated his friendship. Massinissa now quitted
Spain for a while for Africa, and was again engaged in a war
with Syphax in which he was decidedly worsted. Scipio&rsquo;s arrival
in Africa in 204 gave him another chance, and no sooner had
he joined the Roman general than he crushed his old enemy
Syphax, and captured his capital Cirta (Constantine). Here
occurs the romantic story of Sophonisba, daughter of the
Carthaginian Hasdrubal, who had been promised in marriage to
Massinissa, but had subsequently become the wife of Syphax.
Massinissa, according to the story, married Sophonisba immediately
after his victory, but was required by Scipio to dismiss
her as a Carthaginian, and consequently an enemy to Rome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page870" id="page870"></a>870</span>
To save her from such humiliation he sent her poison, with which
she destroyed herself. Massinissa was now accepted as a loyal
ally of Rome, and was confirmed by Scipio in the possession of
his kingdom. In the battle of Zama (202) (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Punic Wars</a></span>), he
commanded the cavalry on Scipio&rsquo;s right wing, and materially
assisted the Roman victory. For his services he received the
kingdom of Syphax, and thus under Roman protection he
became master of the whole of Numidia, and his dominions
completely enclosed the Carthaginian territories, now straitened
and reduced at the close of the Second Punic War. It would
seem that he had thoughts of annexing Carthage itself with the
connivance of Rome. In a war which soon followed he was
successful; the remonstrances of Carthage with Rome on the
behaviour of her ally were answered by the appointment of
Scipio as arbitrator; but, as though intentionally on the part
of Rome, no definite settlement was arrived at, and thus the
relations between Massinissa and the Carthaginians continued
strained. Rome, it is certain, deliberately favoured her ally&rsquo;s
unjust claims with the view of keeping Carthage weak, and
Massinissa on his part was cunning enough to retain the friendship
of the Roman people by helping them with liberal supplies
in their wars against Perseus of Macedon and Antiochus. As
soon as Carthage seemed to be recovering herself, and some of
Massinissa&rsquo;s partisans were driven from the city into exile, his
policy was to excite the fears of Rome, till at last in 149 war
was declared&mdash;the Third Punic War, which ended in the final
overthrow of Carthage. The king took some part in the negotiations
which preceded the war, but died soon after its commencement
in the ninetieth year of his age and the sixtieth of
his reign.</p>

<p>Massinissa was an able ruler and a decided benefactor to
Numidia. He converted a plundering tribe into a settled and
civilized population, and out of robbers and marauders made
efficient and disciplined soldiers. To his sons he bequeathed
a well-stored treasury, a formidable army, and even a fleet.
Cirta (<i>q.v.</i>), his capital, became a famous centre of Phoenician
civilization. In fact Massinissa changed for the better the whole
aspect of a great part of northern Africa. He had much of
the Arab nature, was singularly temperate, and equal to any
amount of fatigue. His fidelity to Rome was merely that of
temporary expediency. He espoused now one side, and now
the other, but on the whole supported Rome, so that orators
and historians could speak of him as &ldquo;a most faithful ally of
the Roman people.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSON, DAVID<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (1822-1907), Scottish man of letters, was
born at Aberdeen on the 2nd of December 1822, and educated
at the grammar school there and at Marischal College. Intending
to enter the Church, he proceeded to Edinburgh University,
where he studied theology under Dr Chalmers, whose friendship
he enjoyed until the divine&rsquo;s death in 1847. However, abandoning
his project of the ministry, he returned to his native city
to undertake the editorship of the <i>Banner</i>, a weekly paper
devoted to the advocacy of Free Kirk principles. After two
years he resigned this post and went back to the capital, bent
upon pursuing a purely literary career. There he wrote a great
deal, contributing to <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, <i>Dublin University
Magazine</i> (in which appeared his essays on Chatterton) and
other periodicals. In 1847 he went to London, where he found
wider scope for his energy and knowledge. He was secretary
(1851-1852) of the &ldquo;Society of the Friends of Italy.&rdquo; In a
famous interview with Mrs Browning at Florence he contested
her admiration for Napoleon III. He had known De Quincey,
whose biography he contributed in 1878 to the &ldquo;English Men
of Letters&rdquo; series, and he was an enthusiastic friend and admirer
of Carlyle. In 1852 he was appointed professor of English
literature at University College, London, in succession to
A. H. Clough, and from 1858 to 1865 he edited the newly
established <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i>. In 1865 he was selected
for the chair of rhetoric and English literature at Edinburgh,
and during the early years of his professorship actively promoted
the movement for the university education of women.
In 1879 he became editor of the Register of the Scottish Privy
Council, and in 1893 was appointed Historiographer Royal for
Scotland. Two years later he resigned his professorship. His
<i>magnum opus</i> in his <i>Life of Milton in Connexion with the History
of His Own Time</i> in six volumes, the first of which appeared
in 1858 and the last in 1880. He also edited the library edition
of Milton&rsquo;s <i>Poetical Works</i> (3 vols., 1874), and De Quincey&rsquo;s
<i>Collected Works</i> (14 vols., 1889-1890). Among his other publications
are <i>Essays, Biographical and Critical</i> (1856, reprinted
with additions, 3 vols., 1874), <i>British Novelists and their Styles</i>
(1859), <i>Drummond of Hawthornden</i> (1873), <i>Chatterton</i> (1873) and
<i>Edinburgh Sketches</i> (1892). He died on the 6th of October 1907.
A bust of Masson was presented to the senate of the university
of Edinburgh in 1897. Professor Masson had married Rosaline
Orme. His son Orme Masson became professor of chemistry
in the university of Melbourne, and his daughter Rosaline is
known as a writer and novelist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASSON, LOUIS CLAUDE FRÉDÉRIC<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (1847-&emsp;&emsp;), French
historian, was born at Paris on the 8th of March 1847. His
father, Francis Masson, a solicitor, was killed on the 23rd of
June 1848, when major in the <i>garde nationale</i>. Young Masson
was educated at the college of Sainte Barbe, and at the lycée
Louis-le-Grand, and then travelled in Germany and in England;
from 1869 to 1880 he was librarian at the Foreign Office. At
first he devoted himself to the history of diplomacy, and published
between 1877 and 1884 several volumes connected with
that subject. Later he published a number of more or less
curious memoirs illustrating the history of the Revolution and
of the empire. But he is best known for his books connected
with Napoleon. In <i>Napoléon inconnu</i> (1895), Masson, together
with M. Guido Biagi, brought out the unpublished writings
(1786-1793) of the future emperor. These were notes, extracts
from historical, philosophical and literary books, and personal
reflections in which one can watch the growth of the ideas later
carried out by the emperor with modifications necessitated by
the force of circumstances and his own genius. But this was
only one in a remarkable series: <i>Joséphine de Beauharnais,
1763-1796</i> (1898); <i>Joséphine, impératrice et reine</i> (1899);
<i>Joséphine répudiée 1809-1814</i> (1901); <i>L&rsquo;Impératrice Marie Louise</i>
(1902); <i>Napoléon et les femmes</i> (1894); <i>Napoléon et sa famille</i>
(9 vols., 1897-1907); <i>Napoléon et son fils</i> (1904); and <i>Autour de
l&rsquo;Île d&rsquo;Elbe</i> (1908). These works abound in details and amusing
anecdotes, which throw much light on the events and men of
the time, laying stress on the personal, romantic and dramatic
aspects of history. The author was made a member of the
Académie française in 1903. From 1886 to 1889 he edited the
review <i>Arts and Letters</i>, published in London and New York.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">MAST<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (1) (O. Eng. <i>maest</i>; a common Teutonic word, cognate
with Lat. <i>malus</i>; from the medieval latinized form <i>mastus</i> comes
Fr. <i>mât</i>), in nautical language, the name of the spar, or straight
piece of timber, or combination of spars, on which are hung the
yards and sails of a vessel of any size. It has been ingeniously
supposed that man himself was the first mast. He discovered
by standing up in his prehistoric &ldquo;dugout,&rdquo; or canoe, that the
wind blowing on him would carry his craft along. But the
origin of the mast, like that of the ship, is lost in times anterior to
all record. The earliest form of mast which prevailed till the
close of the middle ages, and is still in use for small vessels, was
and is a single spar made of some tough and elastic wood; the
conifers supply the best timber for the purpose. In sketching
the history of the development of the mast, we must distinguish
between the increase in the number erected, and the improvements
made in the mast itself. The earliest ships had only one,
carrying a single sail. So little is known of the rigging of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page871" id="page871"></a>871</span>
classical ships that nothing can be affirmed of them with absolute
confidence. The Norse vessels carried one mast placed in the
middle. The number gradually increased till it reached four or
five. All were at first upright, but the mast which stood nearest
the bow was by degrees lowered forward till it became the
bow-sprit of modern times, and lost the name of mast. The
next from the bows became the foremast&mdash;called in Mediterranean
sea language <i>mizzana</i>, in French <i>misaine</i>. Then came
the main-mast&mdash;in French <i>grand mât</i>; and then the mizen&mdash;in
French, which follows the Mediterranean usage, the <i>artimon</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;next the rudder,&rdquo; <i>timon</i>. A small mast was sometimes
erected in the very end of the ship, and called in English a
&ldquo;bonaventure mizen.&rdquo; It had a close resemblance to the jigger
of yawl-rigged yachts. By the close of the 16th century it had
become the established rule that a ship proper had three masts&mdash;fore,
main and mizen. The third takes its name not as the other
two do, from its place, but from the lateen sail originally hoisted
on it (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rigging</a></span>), which was placed fore and aft in the middle
(Italian, <i>mizzo</i>) of the ship, and did not lie across like the courses
and topsails. With the development of very large sailing
clippers in the middle of the 19th century a return was made
to the practice of carrying more than three masts. Ships and
barques are built with four or five. Some of the large schooners
employed in the American coast trade have six or seven, and
some steamers have had as many.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The mast was for long made out of a single spar. Thence the
Mediterranean name of &ldquo;palo&rdquo; (spar) and the Spanish &ldquo;arbol&rdquo;
(tree). The typical Mediterranean mast of &ldquo;lateen&rdquo; (Latin) vessels
is short and bends forward. In other classes it is upright, or bends
slightly backwards with what is called a &ldquo;rake.&rdquo; The mast is
grounded, or in technical language &ldquo;stepped,&rdquo; on the kelson (or
keelson), the solid timber or metal beam lying parallel with, and
above the keel. As the 15th century advanced the growth of the
ship made it difficult, or even impossible, to find spars large enough
to make a mast. The practice of dividing it into lower, and upper
or topmast, was introduced. At first the two were fastened firmly,
and the topmast could not be lowered. In the 16th century the topmast
became movable. No date can be given for the change, which
was gradual, and was not simultaneously adopted. When the
masting of sailing ships was fully developed, the division was into
lower or standing mast, topmast, topgallant mast, and topgallant
royal. The topgallant royal is a small spar which is often a continuation
of the topgallant mast, and is fixed. Increase of size also made
it impossible to construct each of these subdivisions out of single
timbers. A distinction was made between &ldquo;whole&rdquo; or single-spar
masts and &ldquo;armed&rdquo; and &ldquo;made masts.&rdquo; The first were used for
the lighter spars, for small vessels and the Mediterranean craft called
&ldquo;polacras.&rdquo; Armed masts were composed of two single timbers.
Made masts were built of many pieces, bolted and &ldquo;coaked,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
dovetailed and fitted together, fastened round by iron hoops, and
between them by twelve or thirteen close turns of rope, firmly
secured. &ldquo;Made masts&rdquo; are stronger than those made of a single
tree and less liable to be sprung. The general principle of construction
is that it is built round a central shaft, called in English the
&ldquo;spindle&rdquo; or &ldquo;upper tree,&rdquo; and in French the <i>mèche</i> or wick.
The other pieces&mdash;&ldquo;side trees,&rdquo; &ldquo;keel pieces,&rdquo; &ldquo;side fishes,&rdquo; &ldquo;cant
pieces&rdquo; and &ldquo;fillings&rdquo; are &ldquo;coaked,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> dovetailed and bolted on
to and around the &ldquo;spindle,&rdquo; which itself is made of two pieces,
coaked and bolted. The whole is bound by iron bands, and between
the bands, by rope firmly &ldquo;woulded&rdquo; or turned round, and nailed
tight. The art of constructing made masts, like that of building
wooden ships, is in process of dying out. In sailing men-of-war
the mizen-mast often did not reach to the kelson, but was stepped
on the orlop deck. Hollow metal cylinders are now used as masts.
In the case of a masted screw steamer the masts abaft the engines
could not be stepped on the kelson because they would interfere
with the shaft of the screw. It is therefore necessary to step them
on the lower deck, where they are supported by stanchions, or on a
horseshoe covering the screw shaft. The size of masts naturally
varies very much. In a 110-gun ship of 2164 tons the proportions
of the mainmast were: for the lower mast, length 117 ft., diameter
3 ft. 3 in.; topmast, 70 ft., and 20¾ in.; topgallant mast, 35 ft., and
11<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in., 222 ft. in all. At the other end of the scale, a cutter of 200
tons had a lower mast of 88 ft., of 22 in. diameter, and a topgallant
mast (there was no topmast between them) of 44 ft., of 9¾ in. in
diameter, 132 ft. in all; topgallant mast of 44 ft., and 9¾ in. in diameter.
The masts of a warship were more lofty than those of a
merchant ship of the same tonnage. At present masts are only
used by warships for signalling and military purposes. In sailing
merchant ships, the masts are more lofty than they were about
a century ago. A merchant ship of 1300 tons, in 1830, had a mainmast
179 ft. in height; a vessel of the same size would have a mast
of 198 ft. to-day.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;jury mast&rdquo; is a temporary mast put up by the crew when
the spars nave been carried away in a storm or in action, or have been
cut away to relieve pressure in a storm. The word has been supposed
without any foundation to be short for &ldquo;injury&rdquo; mast; it may be
a mere fanciful sailor adaptation of &ldquo;jury&rdquo; in some connexion now
lost. Skeat suggests that it is short for O. Fr. <i>ajourie</i>, Lat. <i>adjutare</i>,
to aid. There is no reason to connect with <i>jour</i>, day.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASTER<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (Lat. <i>magister</i>, related to <i>magis</i>, more, as the
corresponding <i>minister</i> is to <i>minus</i>, less; the English form is
due partly to the O. Eng. <i>maegister</i>, and partly to O. Fr. <i>maistre</i>,
mod. <i>maître</i>; cf. Du. <i>meester</i>, Ger. <i>Meister</i>, Ital. <i>maestro</i>), one
holding a position of authority, disposition or control over
persons or things. The various applications of the word fall
roughly into the following main divisions; as the title of the
holder of a position of command or authority; as that of the
holder of certain public or private offices, and hence a title of
address; and as implying the relationship of a teacher to his
pupils or of an employer to the persons he employs. As a title
of the holder of an office, the use of the Lat. <i>magister</i> is very
ancient. <i>Magister equitum</i>, master of the horse, goes back to
the early history of the Roman Republic (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dictator</a></span>; and
for the British office, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Master of the Horse</a></span>). In medieval
times the title was of great frequency. In Du Cange (<i>Glossarium</i>)
the article <i>magister</i> contains over 120 sub-headings. In the
British royal household most of the offices bearing this title are
now obsolete. Of the greater offices, that of master of the
buckhounds was abolished by the Civil List Act 1901. The
master of the household, master of the ceremonies, master of
the king&rsquo;s music still survive. Since 1870 the office of master
of the mint has been held by the chancellor of the exchequer,
all the administrative and other duties being exercised by the
deputy master.</p>

<p>At sea, a &ldquo;master&rdquo; is more properly styled &ldquo;master mariner.&rdquo;
In the merchant service he is the commander of a ship, and is
by courtesy known as the captain. In the British navy he was
the officer entrusted with the navigation under the captain.
He had no royal commission, but a warrant from the Navy
Board. Very often he had been a merchant captain. His
duties are now performed by the staff commander or navigating
lieutenant. The master-at-arms is the head of the internal
police of a ship; the same title is borne by a senior gymnastic
instructor in the army. In the United States navy, the master
is a commissioned officer below the rank of lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master&rdquo; appears as the title of many legal functionaries
(for the masters of the supreme court see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chancery</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">King&rsquo;s
Bench, Court of</a></span>; for masters in lunacy see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Insanity</a></span>:

of the faculties&rdquo; is the chief officer of the archbishop of Canterbury
in his court of faculties. His duties are concerned with
the appointment of notaries and the granting of special licences
of marriage. The duties are performed <i>ex officio</i> by the judge
of the provincial courts of Canterbury and York, who is also
dean of Arches, in accordance with § 7 of the Public Worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page872" id="page872"></a>872</span>
Regulation Act 1874. The &ldquo;master of the Temple&rdquo; is the
title of the priest-in-charge of the Temple Church in London.
It was formerly the title of the grand master of the Knights
Templars. The priest-in-charge of the Templars&rsquo; Church was
properly styled the <i>custos</i>, and this was preserved by the Knights
Hospitallers when they were granted the property of the
Templars at the dissolution of that order. The act of 1540
(32 Henry VIII.), which dissolved the order of the Hospitallers,
wrongly styled the <i>custos</i> master of the Temple, and the mistake
has been continued. The proper title of a bencher of the Inns
of Court is &ldquo;master of the Bench&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Inns of Court</a></span>). The
title of &ldquo;Master-General of the Ordnance&rdquo; was revived in 1904
for the head of the Ordnance Department in the British military
administration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master&rdquo; is the ordinary word for a teacher, very generally
used in the compound &ldquo;schoolmaster.&rdquo; The word also is
used in a sense transferred from this to express the relation
between the founder of a school of religion, philosophy, science,
art, &amp;c., and his disciples. It is partly in this sense and partly
in that of one whose work serves as a model or type of superlative
excellence that such terms as &ldquo;old masters&rdquo; are used. In
medieval universities <i>magister</i> was particularly applied to one
who had been granted a degree carrying with it the <i>licentia
docendi</i>, the licence to teach. In English usage this survives
in the faculty of arts. The degree is that of <i>artium magister</i>,
master of arts, abbreviated M.A. In the other faculties the
corresponding degree is doctor. Some British universities give
a master&rsquo;s degree in surgery, <i>magister chirurgiae</i>, C.M. or M.Ch.,
and also in science, <i>magister scientiae</i>, M.Sc. The academic
use of &ldquo;master&rdquo; as the title of the head of certain colleges at
the universities of Oxford and Cambridge is to be referred to
the frequent application of the term to the holder of a presiding
office in an institution.</p>

<p>Master was the usual prefix of address to a man&rsquo;s name,
though originally confined to people of some social standing.
Probably under the influence of &ldquo;mistress,&rdquo; it was corrupted
in sound to &ldquo;mister,&rdquo; and was abbreviated to &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; In the
case of the puisne judges of the High Court &ldquo;Mr Justice&rdquo; is
still used as the proper official form of written address. The
Speaker of the House of Commons is also formally addressed
as &ldquo;Mr Speaker.&rdquo; In some Scottish peerages below the rank
of earl, &ldquo;master&rdquo; is used in the courtesy title of the heir, <i>e.g.</i>
the &ldquo;Master of Ruthven.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASTER AND SERVANT.<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> These are scarcely to be considered
as technical terms in English law. The relationship
which they imply is created when one man hires the labour
of another for a term. Thus it is not constituted by merely
contracting with another for the performance of a definite work,
or by sending an article to an artificer to be repaired, or engaging
a builder to construct a house. Nor would the employment
of a man for one definite act of personal service&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the engagement
of a messenger for a single occasion&mdash;generally make the one
master and the other servant. It was held, however, in relation
to the offence of embezzlement, that a drover employed on one
occasion to drive cattle home from market was a servant within
the statute. On the other hand, there are many decisions
limiting the meaning of &ldquo;servants&rdquo; under wills giving legacies
to the class of servants generally. Thus &ldquo;a person who was
not obliged to give his whole time to the master, but was yet
in some sense a servant,&rdquo; was held not entitled to share in a
legacy to the servants. These cases are, however, interpretations
of wills where the intention obviously is to benefit domestic
servants only. And so in other connexions questions may arise
as to the exact nature of the relations between the parties&mdash;whether
they are master and servant, or principal and agent,
or landlord and tenant, or partners, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The terms of the contract of service are for the most part
such as the parties choose to make them, but in the absence
of express stipulations terms will be implied by the law. Thus,
&ldquo;where no time is limited either expressly or by implication for
the duration of a contract of hiring and service, the hiring is
considered as a general hiring, and in point of law a hiring for
a year.&rdquo; But &ldquo;in the case of domestic and menial servants
there is a well-known rule, founded solely on custom, that their
contract of service may be determined at any time by giving a
month&rsquo;s warning or paying a month&rsquo;s wages, but a domestic or
other yearly servant, <i>wrongfully</i> quitting his master&rsquo;s service,
forfeits all claim to wages for that part of the current year
during which he has served, and cannot claim the sum to which
his wages would have amounted had he kept his contract,
merely deducting therefrom one month&rsquo;s wages. Domestic
servants have a right by custom to leave their situations at
any time on payment of a calendar month&rsquo;s wages in advance,
just as a master may discharge them in a similar manner&rdquo;
(Manley Smith&rsquo;s <i>Law of Master and Servant</i>, chs. ii. and iii.).
The following are sufficient grounds for discharging a servant:
(1) wilful disobedience of any lawful order; (2) gross moral misconduct;
(3) habitual negligence; (4) incompetence or permanent
disability caused by illness. A master has a right of action
against any person who deprives him of the services of his
servant, by enticing him away, harbouring or detaining him after
notice, confining or disabling him, or by seducing his female
servant. Indeed, the ordinary and only available action for
seduction in English law is in form of a claim by a parent for the
loss of his daughter&rsquo;s services. The death of either master or
servant in general puts an end to the contract. A servant
wrongfully discharged may either treat the contract as rescinded
and sue for services actually rendered, or he may bring a special
action for damages for the breach. The common law liabilities
of a master towards his servants have been further regulated
by the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Acts (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Employer&rsquo;s Liability</a></span>).
A master is bound to provide food for a servant
living under his roof, and wilful breach of duty in that respect
is a misdemeanour under the Offences against the Person Act
1861.</p>

<p>A servant has no right to demand &ldquo;a character&rdquo; from an
employer, and if a character be given it will be deemed a privileged
communication, so that the master will not be liable
thereon to the servant unless it be false and malicious. A master
by knowingly giving a false character of a servant to an intending
employer may render himself liable&mdash;should the servant for
example rob or injure his new master.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASTER OF THE HORSE,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> in England, an important official
of the sovereign&rsquo;s household. The master of the horse is the
third dignitary of the court, and is always a member of the
ministry (before 1782 the office was of cabinet rank), a peer
and a privy councillor. All matters connected with the horses
and hounds of the sovereign, as well as the stables and coach-houses,
the stud, mews and kennels, are within his jurisdiction.
The practical management of the royal stables and stud devolves
on the chief or crown equerry, formerly called the gentleman
of the horse, who is never in personal attendance on the sovereign
and whose appointment is permanent. The clerk marshal has
the supervision of the accounts of the department before they
are submitted to the Board of Green Cloth, and is in waiting on
the sovereign on state occasions only. Exclusive of the crown
equerry there are seven regular equerries, besides extra and
honorary equerries, one of whom is always in attendance on
the sovereign and rides at the side of the royal carriage. They
are always officers of the army, and each of them is &ldquo;on duty&rdquo;
for about the same time as the lords and grooms in waiting.
There are also several pages of honour in the master of the
horse&rsquo;s department, who must not be confounded with the pages
of various kinds who are in the department of the lord chamberlain.
They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen, selected
by the sovereign in person, to attend on him at state ceremonies,
when two of them, arrayed in an antique costume, assist the
groom of the stole in carrying the royal train.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In France the master of the horse (&ldquo;Grand Écuyer,&rdquo; or more
usually &ldquo;Monsieur le grand&rdquo;) was one of the seven great officers
of the crown from 1617. As well as the superintendence of the royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page873" id="page873"></a>873</span>
stables, he had that of the retinue of the sovereign, also the charge
of the funds set aside for the religious functions of the court, coronations,
&amp;c. On the death of a sovereign he had the right to all the
horses and their equipment in the royal stables. Distinct from this
officer and independent of him, was the first equerry (&ldquo;Premier
Écuyer&rdquo;), who had charge of the horses which the sovereign used
personally (&ldquo;la petite écurie&rdquo;), and who attended on him when he
rode out. The office of master of the horse existed down to the reign
of Louis XVI. Under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. the duties
were discharged by the first equerry, but under Napoléon I. and
Napoléon III. the office was revived with much of its old importance.</p>

<p>In Germany the master of the horse (Oberststallmeister) is a high
court dignitary; but his office is merely titular, the superintendence
of the king&rsquo;s stables being carried out by the Oberstallmeister, an
official corresponding to the crown equerry in England.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASTER OF THE ROLLS,<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> the third member of the Supreme
Court of Judicature in England, the lord chancellor, president
of the chancery division, being the first, and the lord chief
justice, president of the king&rsquo;s bench division, being the second.
At first he was the principal clerk of the chancery, and as such
had charge of the records of the court, especially of the register
of original writs and of all patents and grants under the Great
Seal. Until the end of the 15th century he was called either the
clerk or the keeper of the rolls, and he is still formally designated
as the master or keeper of the rolls. The earliest mention of
him as master of the rolls is in an act of 1495; and in another
act of the same year he is again described as clerk of the rolls,
showing that his official designation still remained unsettled.
About the same period, however, the chief clerks of the chancery
came to be called masters in chancery, and the clerk, master or
keeper of the rolls was always the first among them, whichever
name they bore. In course of time, from causes which are not
very easy to trace, his original functions as keeper of the records
passed away from him and he gradually assumed a jurisdiction
in the court of chancery second only to that of the lord chancellor
himself. In the beginning he only heard causes in conjunction
with the other masters in chancery, and his decrees
were invalid until they had been approved and signed by the
lord chancellor. Sitting in the Rolls chapel or in the court in
Rolls yard, he heard causes without assistance, and his decrees
held good until they were reversed on petition either to the
lord chancellor or afterwards to the lords justices of appeal.
Before any judge with the formal title of vice-chancellor was
appointed the master of the rolls was often spoken of as vice-chancellor,
and in theory acted as such, sitting only when the
lord chancellor was not sitting and holding his court in the
evening from six o&rsquo;clock to ten. Only since 1827 has the master
of the rolls sat in the morning hours. By the Public Record
Office Act 1838 the custody of the records was restored to him,
and he is chairman of the State Papers and Historical Manuscripts
Commissions. Under the Judicature Act 1875, and the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, he now always sits with the
lords justices in the court of appeal (which usually sits in two
divisions of three judges, the master of the rolls presiding over
one division), whose decisions can be questioned only in the
House of Lords. The master of the rolls was formerly eligible
to a seat in the House of Commons&mdash;a privilege enjoyed by
no other member of the judicial bench;<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but he was deprived of
it by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which provides
that all judges of the High Court of Justice and the court of
appeal shall be incapable of being elected to or sitting in the
House of Commons. The master of the rolls is always sworn
of the privy council. His salary is £6000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MASTIC,<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mastich</span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="mastichê">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#967;&#951;</span>, probably connected with
<span class="grk" title="masasthai">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#8118;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>, to chew, since mastic is used in the East as a chewing
gum), a resinous exudation obtained from the lentisk, <i>Pistacia
lentiscus</i>, an evergreen shrub of the natural order Anacardiaceae.
The lentisk or mastic plant is indigenous to the Mediterranean
coast region from Syria to Spain, but grows also in Portugal,
Morocco and the Canaries. Although experiments have proved
that excellent mastic might be obtained in other islands in the
archipelago, the production of the substance has been, since
the time of Dioscorides, almost exclusively confined to the
island of Chios. The mastic districts of that island are for the
most part flat and stony, with little hills and few streams. The
shrubs are about 6 ft. high. The resin is contained in the bark
and not in the wood, and in order to obtain it numerous vertical
incisions are made, during June, July and August, in the stem
and chief branches. The resin speedily exudes and hardens into
roundish or oval tears, which are collected, after about fifteen
days, by women and children, in little baskets lined with white
paper or cotton wool. The ground around the trees is kept
hard and clean, and flat pieces of stone are often laid beneath
them to prevent any droppings of resin from becoming contaminated
with dirt. The collection is repeated three or four
times between June and September, a fine tree being found to
yield about 8 or 10 &#8468; of mastic during the season. Besides
that obtained from the incisions, mastic of very fine quality
spontaneously exudes from the small branches. The harvest
is affected by showers of rain during the period of collection,
and the trees are much injured by frost, which is, however, of
rare occurrence in the districts where they grow. Mastic occurs
in commerce in the form of roundish tears about the size of
peas. They are transparent, with a glassy fracture, of a pale
yellow or faint greenish tinge, which darkens slowly by age.
During the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries mastic enjoyed a high
reputation as a medicine, and formed an ingredient in a large
number of medical compounds; but its use in medicine is now
obsolete, and it is chiefly employed for making varnish.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Pistacia Khinjuk</i> and <i>P. cabulica</i>, trees growing throughout
Sindh, Baluchistan and Cabul, yield a kind of mastic which is met
with in the Indian bazaars under the name of <i>Mustagir&#363;m&#299;</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
Roman mastic. This when occurring in the European market is
known as East Indian or Bombay mastic. In Algeria <i>P. Atlantica</i>
yields a solid resin, which is collected and used by the Arabs as a
masticatory. Cape mastic is the produce of <i>Euryops multifidus</i>,
the resin bush, or <i>harpuis bosch</i> of the Boers&mdash;a plant of the composite
order growing abundantly in the Clanwilliam district. Dammar
resin is sometimes sold under the name of mastic. The West
Indian mastic tree is the <i>Bursera gummifera</i> and the Peruvian
mastic is <i>Schinus molle</i>; but neither of these furnishes commercial
resins. The name mastic tree is also applied to a timber tree, <i>Sider
oxylon mastichodendron</i>, nat. ord. Sapotaceae, which grows in the
West Indies and on the coast of Florida.</p>

by Cuvier to the Pliocene and Miocene forerunners of the
elephants, on account of the nipple-like prominences on the
molar teeth of some of the species (fig. 2), which are of a much
simpler type than those of true elephants. Mastodons, like
elephants, always have a pair of upper tusks, while the earlier
ones likewise have a short pair in the lower jaw, which is
prolonged into a snout-like symphysis for their support. These
long-chinned mastodons are now regarded as forming a genus
by themselves (<i>Tetrabelodon</i>), well-known examples of this
group being <i>Tetrabelodon angustidens</i> from the Miocene and
<i>T. longirostris</i> (fig. 1 C.) from the Lower Pliocene of the Continent.
In the former the upper tusks are bent down so as to
cross the tips of the short and chisel-like lower pair. These
long-chinned mastodons must have had an extremely elongated
muzzle, formed by the upper lip and nose above and the lower
lip below, with which they were able to reach the ground, the
neck being probably rather longer than in elephants. On the
other hand, in the short-chinned mastodons, as represented by
the Pleistocene North American <i>Mastodon americanus</i> and the
Pliocene European <i>M. turicensis</i> (fig. 1), the chin had shrunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page874" id="page874"></a>874</span>
to the dimensions characteristic of elephants, with the loss of
the lower incisors (or with temporary retention of rudimentary
ones), while at the same time a true elephant-like trunk must
have been developed by the shortening of the lower lip and the
prolongation of the combined upper lip and nose.</p>

<p>Mastodons are found in almost all parts of the world. In
Asia they gave rise to the elephants, while they themselves
originated in Africa from ungulates of more normal type. (See

<div class="condensed">
<p>The upper tusks of the early mastodons differ from those of elephants
in retaining longitudinal bands of enamel. The molar teeth
are six in number on each side, increasing in size from before backwards,
and, as in the elephants, with a horizontal succession, the
anterior teeth being lost before the full development of the posterior
ones, which gradually move forward, taking the place of those that
are destroyed by wear. This process is, however, less fully developed
than in elephants, and as many as three teeth may be in place in
each jaw at one time. There is, moreover, in many species a vertical
succession, affecting either the third, or the third and second, or (in
one American species, <i>Tetrabelodon productus</i>) the first, second and
third of the six molar teeth. These three are therefore reckoned
as milk-molars, and their successors as premolars, while the last three
correspond to the true molars of other mammals. The mode of
succession of the teeth in the mastodons exhibits so many stages of
the process by which the dentition of elephants has been derived
from that of more ordinary mammals. It also shows that the anterior
molars of elephants do not correspond to the premolars of
other ungulates, but to the milk-molars, the early loss of which in
consequence of the peculiar process of horizontal forward-moving
succession does not require their replacement by premolars. Specialized
species like <i>Mastodon americanus</i> have completely lost the
rudimentary premolars.</p>

<p>Mastodons have fewer ridges on their molar teeth than elephants;
the ridges are also less elevated, wider apart, with a thicker enamel
covering, and scarcely any cement filling the space between them.
Sometimes (as in <i>M. americanus</i>) the ridges are simple transverse
wedge-shaped elevations, with straight or concave edges. In other
species the summits of the ridges are divided into conical cusps, and
may have accessory cusps clustering around them (as in <i>M. arvernensis</i>,
fig. 2). When the summits of these are worn by mastication their
surfaces present circles of dentine surrounded by a border of enamel,
and as attrition proceeds different patterns are produced by the
union of the bases of the cusps, a trefoil form being characteristic
of some species.</p>

<p>Certain of the molar teeth of the middle of the series in both
elephants and mastodons have the same number of principal ridges;
those in front having fewer, and those behind a greater number.
These teeth are distinguished as &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; molars. In elephants
there are only two, the last milk-molar and the first true
molar (or the third and fourth of the whole series), which are alike
in the number of ridges; whereas in mastodons there are three such
teeth, the last milk-molar and
the first and second molars
(or the third, fourth and
fifth of the whole series).
In elephants the number of
ridges on the intermediate
molars always exceeds five,
but in mastodons it is nearly
always three or four, and the
tooth in front has usually
one fewer and that behind
one more, so that the ridge-formula
(<i>i.e.</i> a formula expressing
the number of ridges
on each of the six molar teeth)
of most mastodons can be
reduced either to 1, 2, 3, 3, 3,
4, or 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5. Three-ridged
and four-ridged types
occur both in <i>Mastodon</i> and
<i>Tetrabelodon</i>.</p>

at Bagdad towards the
close of the 9th century.
Much of his life was spent
in travel. After he had
been in Persia and Kerman,
he visited Istakhr in 915,
and went in the following year to M&#363;lt&#257;n and Man&#7779;&#363;ra,
thence to Cambay, Saimur and Ceylon, to Madagascar and
back to Oman. He seems about this time to have been
as far as China. After a visit to the shores of the Caspian Sea
he visited Tiberias in Palestine, examined the Christian church
there, and described its relics. In 943 he was in Antioch,
studying the ruins, and two years later in Damascus. The last
ten years of his life he spent in Syria and Egypt. His great
object in life had been to study with his own eyes the peculiarities
of every land and to collect whatever was of interest for
archaeology, history and manners. Himself a Mo&lsquo;tazilite (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahommedan Religion</a></span>: <i>Sects</i>), he was singularly free from
bigotry, and took his information, when necessary, from Persians,
Jews, Indians, and even the chronicle of a Christian bishop.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His most extensive work was the <i>Kit&#257;b akhb&#257;r uz-Zam&#257;n</i> or
<i>Annals</i>, in 30 volumes with a supplement, the <i>Kit&#257;b ul-Ausa&#7789;</i>,
a chronological sketch of general history. Of these the first part
only of the former is extant in MS. in Vienna, while the latter seems
to be in the Bodleian Library, also in MS. The substance of the two
was united by him in the work by which he is now best known, the
<i>Mur&#363;j udh-Dhahab wa Ma&lsquo;&#257;din ul-Jaw&#257;hir</i> (&ldquo;Meadows of Gold and
Mines of Precious Stones&rdquo;), an historical work which he completed
in 947. In 956 he finished a second edition of this and made it
double its former size, but no copy of this seems to be extant. The
original edition has been published at Bul&#257;q and Cairo, and with
French translation by C. Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille
(9 vols., Paris, 1861-1877). Another work of Mas&rsquo;&#363;d&#299;, written in the
last year of his life, is the <i>Kit&#257;b ut-Tanb&#299;h wal Ishr&#257;f</i> (the &ldquo;Book
of Indication and Revision&rdquo;), in which he summarizes the work of
his life and corrects and completes his former writings. It has been
edited by M. J. de Goeje (Leiden, 1894), and a French translation
has been made by Carra de Vaux (Paris, 1896); cf. also the memoir
of S. de Sacy published in Meynard&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Mur&#363;j</i>.</p>

city. Pop. (1901), 39,507. Masulipatam was the earliest
English settlement on the Coromandel coast, its importance
being due to the fact that it was the <i>bandar</i> or port of Golconda.
An agency was established there in 1611. During the wars of
the Carnatic, the English were temporarily expelled <span class="correction" title="added from">from</span> the town,
which was held by the French for some years. In 1759 the
town and fort were carried by storm by Colonel Forde, an
achievement followed by the acquisition of the Northern
Circars (<i>q.v.</i>). In 1864 a great storm-wave swept over the entire
town and is said to have destroyed 30,000 lives. Weavers form
a large portion of the inhabitants, though their trade has greatly
declined since the beginning of the 19th century. Their operations,
besides weaving, include printing, bleaching, washing and
dressing. In former days the chintzes of Masulipatam had a
great reputation abroad for the freshness and permanency of
their dyes. Masulipatam is a station of the Church Missionary
Society. The port is only a roadstead, where vessels anchor
5 m. out. A branch line from Bezwada on the Southern
Mahratta railway was opened in 1908. The chief educational
institution is the Noble College of the C.M.S.</p>

The finer fabrics are known as &ldquo;matting&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>). Mats are

cork, or of thickly coiled wire. Bags, rolls or sacks made of
matting are used to hold coffee, flax, rice and other produce,

Boers in 1837, Mosilikatze crossed the Limpopo with a military
host which had been recruited from every tribe conquered by
him during his ten years&rsquo; predominance in the Transvaal. In
their new territories the Matabele absorbed into their ranks
many members of the conquered Mashona tribes and established
a military despotism. Their sole occupation was war, for which
their laws and organization were designed to fit them. This
system of constant warfare is, since the conquest of Matabeleland
by the British in 1893, a thing of the past. The Matabele are

mouth, opposite Brownsville, Texas. Pop. (1900), 8347.
Matamoros stands in an open plain, the commercial centre for a
large district, but its import trade is prejudiced by the bar at
the mouth of the Rio Grande, which permits the entrance of
small vessels only. The exports include hides, wool and live
stock. The importance of the town in the foreign trade of
northern Mexico, however, has been largely diminished by the
great railways. Formerly it was the centre of a large contraband
trade with Brownsville, Texas. Matamoros was founded
early in the 19th century, and was named in honour of the
Mexican patriot Mariano Matamoros (<i>c.</i> 1770-1814). In the war
between the United States and Mexico, Matamoros was easily
taken by the Americans on the 18th of May 1846, following

<p><span class="bold">MATANZAS,<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> an important city of Cuba, capital of Matanzas
Province, situated on a large deep bay on the N. coast, about
54 m. (by rail) E. of Havana. Pop. (1907), 36,009. There are
railway outlets W., S. and E., and Matanzas is served by steamships
to New York and by the coast steamers of the Herrera
Line. The bay, unlike all the other better harbours of the island,
has a broad mouth, 2 m. across, but there is good shelter
against all winds except from the N.E. A coral reef lies
across the entrance. Three rivers emptying into the bay&mdash;the
San Juan, Canimar and Yumuri&mdash;have deposited much silt,
necessitating the use of lighters in loading and unloading large
ships. The city is finely placed at the head of the bay, on a low,
sloping plain backed by wooded hills, over some of which the
city itself has spread. The conical Pan de Matanzas (1277 ft.)
is a striking land-mark for sailors. The San Juan and Yumuri
rivers divide Matanzas into three districts. The Teatro Esteban,
Casino Español and Government House are noteworthy among
the buildings. The broad Paseo de Marti (Alameda de Versalles,
Paseo de Santa Cristina) extends along the edge of the harbour,
and is perhaps the handsomest parkway and boulevard in Cuba.
At one end is a statue of Ferdinand VII., at the other a monument
to 63 Cubans executed by the Spanish Government as traitors
for bearing arms in the cause of independence. A splendid
military road continues the Paseo to the Castillo de San Serverino
(built in 1694-1695, reconstructed in 1773 and following years).
There are two smaller forts, established in the 18th century. Near
Matanzas are two of the most noted natural resorts of Cuba:
the valley of the Yumuri, and the caves of Bellamar. Commanding
the Yumuri Valley is the hill called Cumbre, on which
is the Hermitage of Monteserrate (1870), with a famous shrine.
Matanzas is the second port of the island in commerce. Sugar
and molasses are the chief exports. The city is the chief outlet
for the sugar product of the province, which, with the province
of Santa Clara, produces two-thirds of the crop of the island.
There are many large warehouses, rum distilleries, sugar-mills
and railway machine-shops. Matanzas is frequently mentioned
in the annals of the 16th and 17th centuries, when its bay was
frequented by buccaneers; but the city was not laid out until
1693. In the next year it received an <i>ayuntamiento</i> (council).
Its prosperity rapidly increased after the establishment of free
commerce early in the 19th century. In 1815 it was made a
department capital. The mulatto poet, Gabriel de la Concepción
Valdés, known as Plácido (1809-1844), was born in Matanzas, and
was executed there for participation in the supposed conspiracy
of negroes in 1844, which is one of the most famous episodes in
Cuban history. The hurricanes of 1844 and 1846 are the only
other prominent local events. American commercial influence
has always been particularly strong.</p>

of the new town, lying next the sea, are wide and regularly
built; those of the old town, farther up the hill, still preserve
much of their ancient character. The parish church of Santa
Maria has some good pictures and wood carvings. The wine of
the neighbourhood, which resembles port, is shipped in large
quantities from Barcelona; and the district furnishes fine roses
and strawberries for the Barcelona market. The leading industries
are manufactures of linen and cotton goods, especially
canvas and tarpaulin, and of soap, paper, chemicals, starch,
glass, leather, spirits and flour. The railway to Barcelona,

<p><span class="bold">MATCH:<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> 1. O. Eng. <i>gemaecca</i>, a cognate form of &ldquo;make,&rdquo;
meaning originally &ldquo;fit&rdquo; or &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;; a pair, or one of a pair
of objects, persons or animals. As particularly applied to a
husband and wife, and hence to a marriage, the word is especially
used of two persons or things which correspond exactly to each
other. The verb &ldquo;to match&rdquo; has also the meaning to &ldquo;pit
one against each other,&rdquo; and so is applied in sport to an arranged
contest between individuals or sides.</p>

<p>2. O. Fr. <i>mesche</i>; apparently from a latinized form of Gr.
<span class="grk" title="myxa">&#956;&#973;&#958;&#945;</span>, mucus from the nose, applied to the nozzle of a lamp;
primarily the wick which conveys oil or molten wax to the flame
of a lamp or candle (this use is now obsolete), the word being then
applied to various objects having the property of carrying fire.
With early firearms a match, consisting of a cord of hemp or
similar material treated with nitre and other substances so that
it continued to smoulder after it had been ignited, was used for
firing the charge, being either held in the gunner&rsquo;s hand or attached
to the cock of the musket or arquebus and brought down
by the action of the trigger on the powder priming (&ldquo;matchlock&rdquo;);
and more or less similar preparations, made to burn more
or less rapidly as required (&ldquo;quick-match&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow-match&rdquo;),
are employed as fuses in blasting and demolition work in military
operations. The word &ldquo;match&rdquo; was further used of a splint of
wood, tipped with sulphur so that it would readily ignite, but
it now most commonly means a slip of wood or other combustible
material, having its end covered with a composition which takes
fire when rubbed either on any rough surface or on another
specially prepared composition.</p>

<p>The first attempt to make matches in the modern sense may
probably be ascribed to Godfrey Haukwitz, who, in 1680, acting
under the direction of Robert Boyle, who at that time had just
discovered how to prepare phosphorus, employed small pieces
of that element, ignited by friction, to light splints of wood
dipped in sulphur. This device, however, did not come into
extensive use owing to its danger and inconvenience and to the
cost of the phosphorus, and till the beginning of the 19th century
flint and steel with tinder-box and sulphur-tipped splints of
wood&mdash;&ldquo;spunks&rdquo; or matches&mdash;were the common means of
obtaining fire for domestic and other purposes. The sparks
struck off by the percussion of flint and steel were made to fall
among the tinder, which consisted of carbonized fragments of
cotton and linen; the entire mass of the tinder was set into a glow,
developing sufficient heat to ignite the sulphur with which the
matches were tipped, and thereby the splints themselves were
set on fire. In 1805 one Chancel, assistant to Professor L. J.
Thénard of Paris, introduced an apparatus consisting of a small
bottle containing asbestos, saturated with strong sulphuric acid,
with splints or matches coated with sulphur, and tipped with a
mixture of chlorate of potash and sugar. The matches so prepared,
when brought into contact with the sulphuric acid in the
bottle, ignited, and thus, by chemical action, fire was produced.
In 1823 a decided impetus was given to the artificial production
of fire by the introduction of the Döbereiner lamp, so called after
its inventor, J. W. Döbereiner of Jena. The first really practical
friction matches were made in England in 1827, by John Walker,
a druggist of Stockton-on-Tees. These were known as
&ldquo;Congreves&rdquo; after Sir William Congreve, the inventor of the
Congreve rocket, and consisted of wooden splints or sticks of
cardboard coated with sulphur and tipped with a mixture of
sulphide of antimony, chlorate of potash and gum. With each
box which was retailed at a shilling, there was supplied a folded
piece of glass paper, the folds of which were to be tightly pressed
together, while the match was drawn through between them.
The same idea occurred to Sir Isaac Holden independently two
and a half years later. The so-called &ldquo;Prometheans,&rdquo; patented
by S. Jones of London in 1830, consisted of a short roll of paper
with a small quantity of a mixture of chlorate of potash and
sugar at one end, a thin glass globule of strong sulphuric acid
being attached at the same point. When the sulphuric acid was
liberated by pinching the glass globule, it acted on the mixed
chlorate and sugar, producing fire. The phosphorus friction-match
of the present day was first introduced on a commercial
scale in 1833. It appears to have been made almost simultaneously
in several distinct centres. The name most prominently connected
with the early stages of the invention is that of J. Preschel of
Vienna, who in 1833 had a factory in operation for making phosphorus
matches, fusees, and amadou slips tipped with igniting
composition. At the same time also matches were being made by
F. Moldenhauer in Darmstadt; and for a long series of years
Austria and the South-German states were the principal centres
of the new industry.</p>

<p>But the use of ordinary white or yellow phosphorus as a principal
ingredient in the igniting mixture of matches was found to
be accompanied with very serious disadvantages. It is a deadly
poison, and its free dissemination has led to many accidental
deaths, and to numerous cases of wilful murder and suicide.
Workers also who are exposed to phosphoric vapours are subject
to a peculiarly distressing disease which attacks the jaw, and
ultimately produces necrosis of the jaw-bone (&ldquo;phossy jaw&rdquo;),
though with scrupulous attention to ventilation and cleanliness
much of the risk of the disease may be avoided. The most
serious objections to the use of phosphorus, however, were
overcome by the discovery of the modified form of that body
known as red or amorphous phosphorus. That substance was
utilized for the manufacture of the well-known &ldquo;safety matches&rdquo;
by J. E. Lundström, of Jönköping, Sweden, in 1852; its employment
for this purpose had been patented eight years previously
by another Swede, G. E. Pasch, who, however, regarded it as an
oxide of phosphorus. Red phosphorus is in itself a perfectly
innocuous substance, and no evil effects arise from freely working
the compositions of which it forms an ingredient. The fact again
that safety matches ignite only in exceptional circumstances
on any other than the prepared surfaces which accompany the
box&mdash;which surfaces and not the matches themselves contain
the phosphorus required for ignition&mdash;makes them much less
liable to cause accidental fires than other kinds.</p>

<p>The processes carried out in a match factory include preparing
the splints, dipping them first in molten paraffin wax and then
in the igniting composition, and filling the matches into boxes.
All these operations are performed by complicated automatic

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief element in the igniting mixture of ordinary or &ldquo;strike
anywhere&rdquo; matches used to be common yellow phosphorus, combined
with one or more other bodies which readily part with oxygen
under the influence of heat. Chief among these latter substances
is chlorate of potash, others being red lead, nitrate of lead, bichromate
of potash and peroxide of manganese. But at the beginning
of the 20th century many countries took steps to stop the use of
yellow phosphorus owing to the danger to health attending its
manipulation. In Sweden, matches made with it have been prohibited
for home consumption, but not for export, since 1901. In
1905 and 1906 two conferences, attended by representatives of
most of the governments of Europe, were held at Berne to consider
the question of prohibiting yellow phosphorus, but no general agreement
was reached owing to the objections entertained by Sweden,
Norway, Spain and Portugal, and also Japan. Germany, France,
Italy, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland and Luxemburg, however,
agreed to a convention whereby yellow phosphorus was prohibited
as from 1912, and to this Great Britain expressed her adherence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page877" id="page877"></a>877</span>
after the passing of the White Matches Prohibition Act 1908, which
forbade the manufacture and importation of such matches from the
1st of January 1910; though to avoid hardship to retailers and others
holding large stocks it permitted their sale for a year longer. Phosphorous
sulphide (sesquisulphide of phosphorus) is one of the substances
widely employed as a substitute for yellow phosphorus in
matches which will strike anywhere without the need of a specially
prepared surface.</p>

<p>Safety matches contain no phosphorus in the heads; according to
one formula that has been published the mixture with which they are
tipped consists of chlorate of potash, 32 parts; bichromate of potash,
12; red lead, 32; sulphide of antimony, 24; while the ingredients of
a suitable rubbing surface are eight parts of amorphous phosphorus
to nine of sulphide of antimony. There is no doubt, however,
that there is considerable diversity in the composition of the mixtures
actually employed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vestas&rdquo; are matches in which short pieces of thin &ldquo;wax taper&rdquo;
are used in place of wooden splints. Fusees or vesuvians consist
of large oval heads fixed on a round splint. These heads consist of
a porous mixture of charcoal, saltpetre, cascarilla or other scented
bark, glass and gum, tipped with common igniting composition.
When lighted they form a glowing mass, without flame.</p>

<p>It is calculated that in the principal European countries from six
to ten matches are used for each inhabitant daily, and the world&rsquo;s
annual output must reach a total which requires twelve or thirteen
figures for its expression. In the United States the manufacture
is under the control of the Diamond Match Company, formed in
1881; which company also has an important share in the industry
in Great Britain, where it has established large works. Similarly
the manufacture of safety matches in Sweden is largely controlled
by one big combination. In France matches are a government
monopoly, and are both dear in price and inferior in quality, as
compared with other countries where the industry is left to private
enterprise. The French government formerly leased the manufacture
to a company (<i>Société générale des allumettes chimiques</i>), but since
1890 it has been undertaken directly by the state.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATÉ,<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Paraguay Tea</span>, the dried leaves of <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i>,<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
an evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the same
genus as the common holly, a plant to which it bears some
resemblance in size and habit. The leaves are from 6 to 8 in.
long, shortly stalked, with a somewhat acute tip and finely
toothed at the margin. The small white flowers grow in forked
clusters in the axils of the leaves; the sepals, petals and stamens
are four in number, or occasionally five; and the berry is 4-seeded.
The plant grows abundantly in Paraguay, and the south of
Brazil, forming woods called <i>yerbales</i>. One of the principal
centres of the maté industry is the Villa Real, a small town above
Asuncion on the Paraguay river; another is the Villa de San
Xavier, in the district between the rivers Uruguay and Parana.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Although maté appears to have been used from time immemorial
by the Indians, the Jesuits were the first to attempt its cultivation.
This was begun at their branch missions in Paraguay and the province
of Rio Grande de San Pedro, where some plantations still exist, and
yield the best tea that is made. From this circumstance the names
Jesuits&rsquo; tea, tea of the Missions, St Bartholomew&rsquo;s tea, &amp;c., are
sometimes applied to maté. Under cultivation the quality of the
tea improves, but the plant remains a small shrub with numerous
stems, instead of forming, as in the wild state, a tree with a rounded
head. From cultivated plants the leaves are gathered every
two or three years, that interval being necessary for restoration to
vigorous growth. The collection of maté is, however, chiefly
effected by Indians employed for that purpose by merchants, who
pay a money consideration to government for the privilege.</p>

<p>When a yerbal or maté wood is found, the Indians, who usually
travel in companies of about twenty-five in number, build wigwams
and settle down to the work for about six months. Their first
operation is to prepare an open space, called a <i>tatacua</i>, about 6 ft.
square, in which the surface of the soil is beaten hard and smooth
with mallets. The leafy branches of the maté are then cut down and
placed on the tatacua, where they undergo a preliminary roasting
from a fire kindled around it. An arch of poles, or of hurdles, is
then erected above it, on which the maté is placed, a fire being lighted
underneath. This part of the process demands some care, since
by it the leaves have to be rendered brittle enough to be easily
pulverized, and the aroma has to be developed, the necessary
amount of heat being only learned by experience. After drying,
the leaves are reduced to coarse powder in mortars formed of pits in
the earth well rammed. Maté so prepared is called <i>caa gazu</i> or <i>yerva
do polos</i>, and is chiefly used in Brazil. In Paraguay and the
vicinity of Parana in the Argentine Republic, the leaves are deprived
of the midrib before roasting; this is called <i>caa-míri</i>. A very superior
quality, or <i>caa-cuys</i>, is also prepared in Paraguay from the scarcely
expanded buds. Another method of drying maté has been adopted,
the leaves being heated in large cast-iron pans set in brickwork, in
the same way that tea is dried in China; it is afterwards powdered
by machinery.</p>

<p>The different methods of preparation influence to a certain extent
the value of the product, the maté prepared in Paraguay being
considered the best, that of Oran and Paranagua very inferior. The
leaves when dried are packed tightly in serons or oblong packages
made of raw hides, which are then carefully sewed up. These shrink
by exposure to the sun, and in a couple of days form compact parcels
each containing about 200 &#8468; of tea; in this form it keeps well.
The tea is generally prepared for use in a small silver-mounted
calabash, made of the fruit of <i>Crescentia cujete</i> (Cuca) or of <i>Lagenaria</i>
(Cabaço), usually about the size of a large orange, the tapering
end of the latter serving for a handle. In the top of the calabash,
or <i>maté</i>,<a name="fa2t" id="fa2t" href="#ft2t"><span class="sp">2</span></a> a circular hole about the size of a florin is made, and through
this opening the tea is sucked by means of a bombilla. This instrument
consists of a small tube 6 or 7 in. long, formed either of metal
or a reed, which has at one end a bulb made either of extremely fine
basket-work or of metal perforated with minute holes, so as to
prevent the particles of the tea-leaves from being drawn up into
the mouth. Some sugar and a little hot water are first placed in the
gourd, the yerva is then added, and finally the vessel is filled to the
brim with boiling water, or milk previously heated by a spirit lamp.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page878" id="page878"></a>878</span>
A little burnt sugar or lemon juice is sometimes added instead of
milk. The beverage is then handed round to the company, each
person being furnished with a bombilla. The leaves will bear steeping
about three times. The infusion, if not drunk soon after it is
made, rapidly turns black. Persons who are fond of maté drink
it before every meal, and consume about 1 oz. of the leaves per day.
In the neighbourhood of Parana it is prepared and drunk like
Chinese tea. Maté is generally considered disagreeable by those
unaccustomed to it, having a somewhat bitter taste; moreover, it
is the custom to drink it so hot as to be unpleasant. But in the
south-eastern republics it is a much-prized article of luxury, and is
the first thing offered to visitors. The <i>gaucho</i> of the plains will
travel on horseback for weeks asking no better fare than dried beef
washed down with copious draughts of maté, and for it he will forego
any other luxury, such as sugar, rice or biscuit. Maté acts as a
restorative after great fatigue in the same manner as tea. Since
it does not lose its flavour so quickly as tea by exposure to the air
and damp it is more valuable to travellers.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the 17th century maté has been drunk by
all classes in Paraguay, and it is now used throughout Brazil and the
neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>The virtues of this substance are due to the occurrence in it of
caffeine, of which a given quantity of maté, as prepared for drinking,
contains definitely less than a similar quantity of tea or coffee.
It is less astringent than either of these, and thus is, on all scores,
less open to objection.</p>

Potenza, from which it is 68 m. E. by road (13 m. S. of the station
of Altamura), 1312 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901), 17,801.
Part of it is built on a level plateau and part in deep valleys
adjoining, the tops of the campaniles of the lower portions being
on a level with the streets of the upper. The principal building
is the cathedral of the archbishopric of Acerenza and Matera,
formed in 1203 by the union of the two bishoprics, dating respectively
from 300 and 398. The western façade of the cathedral
is plain, while the utmost richness of decoration is lavished on
the south front which faces the piazza. Almost in the centre
of this south façade is an exquisitely sculptured window, from
which letters from the Greek patriarch at Constantinople used
to be read. The campanile is 175 ft. high. In the vicinity are

<p><span class="bold">MATERIALISM<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>materia</i>, matter), in philosophy,
the theory which regards all the facts of the universe as
explainable in terms of matter and motion, and in particular
explains all psychical processes by physical and chemical changes
in the nervous system. It is thus opposed both to natural
realism and to idealism. For the natural realist stands upon the
common-sense position that minds and material objects have
equally effective existence; while the idealist explains matter by
mind and denies that mind can be explained by matter. The
various forms into which materialism may be classified correspond
to the various causes which induce men to take up materialistic
views. <i>Naïve materialism</i> is due to a cause which still, perhaps,
has no small power, the natural difficulty which persons who have
had no philosophic training experience in observing and appreciating
the importance of the immaterial facts of consciousness.
The pre-Socratics may be classed as naïve materialists in this
sense; though, as at that early period the contrast between
matter and spirit had not been fully realized and matter was
credited with properties that belong to life, it is usual to apply
the term hylozoism (<i>q.v.</i>) to the earliest stage of Greek
metaphysical theory. It is not difficult to discern the influence of
naïve materialism in contemporary thinking. We see it in Huxley,
and still more in Haeckel, whose materialism (which he chooses
to term &ldquo;monism&rdquo;) is evidently conditioned by ignorance
of the history and present position of speculation. <i>Cosmological
materialism</i> is that form of the doctrine in which the dominant
motive is the formation of a comprehensive world-scheme:
the Stoics and Epicureans were cosmological materialists. In
<i>anti-religious materialism</i> the motive is hostility to established
dogmas which are connected, in the Christian system especially,
with certain forms of spiritual doctrine. Such a motive weighed
much with Hobbes and with the French materialists of the
18th century, such as La Mettrie and d&rsquo;Holbach. The cause
of <i>medical materialism</i> is the natural bias of physicians towards
explaining the health and disease of mind by the health and
disease of body. It has received its greatest support from the
study of insanity, which is now fully recognized as conditioned
by disease of the brain. To this school belong Drs Maudsley
and Mercier. The highest form of the doctrine is <i>scientific
materialism</i>, by which term is meant the doctrine so commonly
adopted by the physicist, zoologist and biologist.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be fairly said that materialism is at present a
necessary methodological postulate of natural-scientific inquiry.
The business of the scientist is to explain everything by the
physical causes which are comparatively well understood and to
exclude the interference of spiritual causes. It was the great
work of Descartes to exclude rigorously from science all explanations
which were not scientifically verifiable; and the prevalence
of materialism at certain epochs, as in the enlightenment of
the 18th century and in the German philosophy of the middle
19th, were occasioned by special need to vindicate the scientific
position, in the former case against the Church, in the latter case
against the pseudo-science of the Hegelian dialectic. The chief
definite periods of materialism are the pre-Socratic and the
post-Aristotelian in Greece, the 18th century in France, and in
Germany the 19th century from about 1850 to 1880. In
England materialism has been endemic, so to speak, from
Hobbes to the present time, and English materialism is more
important perhaps than that of any other country. But, from
the national distrust of system, it has not been elaborated into
a consistent metaphysic, but is rather traceable as a tendency
harmonizing with the spirit of natural science. Hobbes, Locke,
Hume, Mill and Herbert Spencer are not systematic materialists,
but show tendencies towards materialism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATER MATUTA<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (connected with Lat. <i>mane</i>, <i>matutinus</i>,
&ldquo;morning&rdquo;), an old Italian goddess of dawn. The idea of light
being closely connected with childbirth, whereby the infant is
brought into the light of the world, she came to be regarded as a
double of Juno, and was identified by the Greeks with Eilithyia.
Matuta had a temple in Rome in the Forum Boarium, where the
festival of Matralia was celebrated on the 11th of June. Only
married women were admitted, and none who had been married
more than once were allowed to crown her image with garlands.
Under hellenizing influences, she became a goddess of sea and
harbours, the Ino-Leucothea of the Greeks. In this connexion
it is noticeable that, as Ino tended her nephew Dionysus, so at
the Matralia the participants prayed for the welfare of their
nephews and nieces before that of their own children. The transformation
was complete in 174 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when Tiberius Sempronius
Gracchus, after the conquest of Sardinia, placed in the temple
of Matuta a map commemorative of the campaign, containing a
plan of the island and the various engagements. The progress
of navigation and the association of divinities of the sky with
maritime affairs probably also assisted to bring about the change,
although the memory of her earlier function as a goddess of
childbirth survived till imperial times.</p>

various applications of mathematical thought, the traditional
field of which is number and quantity. It has been usual to
define mathematics as &ldquo;the science of discrete and continuous
magnitude.&rdquo; Even Leibnitz,<a name="fa1u" id="fa1u" href="#ft1u"><span class="sp">1</span></a> who initiated a more modern point
of view, follows the tradition in thus confining the scope of
mathematics properly so called, while apparently conceiving it
as a department of a yet wider science of reasoning. A short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page879" id="page879"></a>879</span>
consideration of some leading topics of the science will exemplify both
the plausibility and inadequacy of the above definition.
Arithmetic, algebra, and the infinitesimal calculus, are sciences
directly concerned with integral numbers, rational (or fractional)
numbers, and real numbers generally, which include incommensurable
numbers. It would seem that &ldquo;the general theory
of discrete and continuous quantity&rdquo; is the exact description of
the topics of these sciences. Furthermore, can we not complete
the circle of the mathematical sciences by adding geometry?
Now geometry deals with points, lines, planes and cubic contents.
Of these all except points are quantities: lines involve lengths,
planes involve areas, and cubic contents involve volumes. Also,
as the Cartesian geometry shows, all the relations between
points are expressible in terms of geometric quantities. Accordingly,
at first sight it seems reasonable to define geometry in
some such way as &ldquo;the science of dimensional quantity.&rdquo;
Thus every subdivision of mathematical science would appear
to deal with quantity, and the definition of mathematics as
&ldquo;the science of quantity&rdquo; would appear to be justified. We
have now to consider the reasons for rejecting this definition
as inadequate.</p>

<p><i>Types of Critical Questions.</i>&mdash;What are numbers? We can
talk of five apples and ten pears. But what are &ldquo;five&rdquo; and
&ldquo;ten&rdquo; apart from the apples and pears? Also in addition to
the cardinal numbers there are the ordinal numbers: the fifth
apple and the tenth pear claim thought. What is the relation
of &ldquo;the fifth&rdquo; and &ldquo;the tenth&rdquo; to &ldquo;five&rdquo; and &ldquo;ten&rdquo;?
&ldquo;The first rose of summer&rdquo; and &ldquo;the last rose of summer&rdquo;
are parallel phrases, yet one explicitly introduces an ordinal
number and the other does not. Again, &ldquo;half a foot&rdquo; and
&ldquo;half a pound&rdquo; are easily defined. But in what sense is there
&ldquo;a half,&rdquo; which is the same for &ldquo;half a foot&rdquo; as &ldquo;half a
pound&rdquo;? Furthermore, incommensurable numbers are defined
as the limits arrived at as the result of certain procedures with
rational numbers. But how do we know that there is anything
to reach? We must know that &radic;2 exists before we can prove
that any procedure will reach it. An expedition to the North
Pole has nothing to reach unless the earth rotates.</p>

<p>Also in geometry, what is a point? The straightness of a
straight line and the planeness of a plane require consideration.
Furthermore, &ldquo;congruence&rdquo; is a difficulty. For when a triangle
&ldquo;moves,&rdquo; the points do not move with it. So what is it that
keeps unaltered in the moving triangle? Thus the whole
method of measurement in geometry as described in the elementary
textbooks and the older treatises is obscure to the last
degree. Lastly, what are &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo;? All these topics
require thorough discussion before we can rest content with the
definition of mathematics as the general science of magnitude;
and by the time they are discussed the definition has evaporated.
An outline of the modern answers to questions such as the above
will now be given. A critical defence of them would require a
volume.<a name="fa2u" id="fa2u" href="#ft2u"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Cardinal Numbers.</i>&mdash;A one-one relation between the members of
two classes &alpha; and &beta; is any method of correlating all the members
of &alpha; to all the members of &beta;, so that any member of &alpha; has one and
only one correlate in &beta;, and any member of &beta; has one and only one
correlate in &alpha;. Two classes between which a one-one relation exists
have the same cardinal number and are called cardinally similar;
and the cardinal number of the class &alpha; is a certain class whose
members are themselves classes&mdash;namely, it is the class composed
of all those classes for which a one-one correlation with &alpha; exists.
Thus the cardinal number of &alpha; is itself a class, and furthermore &alpha;
is a member of it. For a one-one relation can be established between
the members of &alpha; and &alpha; by the simple process of correlating each
member of &alpha; with itself. Thus the cardinal number one is the class
of unit classes, the cardinal number two is the class of doublets,
and so on. Also a unit class is any class with the property that it
possesses a member <i>x</i> such that, if <i>y</i> is any member of the class,
then <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are identical. A doublet is any class which possesses
a member <i>x</i> such that the modified class formed by all the other
members except <i>x</i> is a unit class. And so on for all the finite
cardinals, which are thus defined successively. The cardinal
number zero is the class of classes with no members; but there is
only one such class, namely&mdash;the null class. Thus this cardinal
number has only one member. The operations of addition and
multiplication of two given cardinal numbers can be defined by
taking two classes &alpha; and &beta;, satisfying the conditions (1) that their
cardinal numbers are respectively the given numbers, and (2) that
they contain no member in common, and then by defining by reference
to &alpha; and &beta; two other suitable classes whose cardinal numbers
are defined to be respectively the required sum and product of
the cardinal numbers in question. We need not here consider the
details of this process.</p>

<p>With these definitions it is now possible to <i>prove</i> the following
six premisses applying to finite cardinal numbers, from which
Peano<a name="fa3u" id="fa3u" href="#ft3u"><span class="sp">3</span></a> has shown that all arithmetic can be deduced:&mdash;</p>

<p>i. Cardinal numbers form a class.</p>

<p>ii. Zero is a cardinal number.</p>

<p>iii. If a is a cardinal number, a + 1 is a cardinal number.</p>

<p>iv. If s is any class and zero is a member of it, also if when x is
a cardinal number and a member of s, also x + 1 is a member of s,
then the whole class of cardinal numbers is contained in s.</p>

<p>v. If a and b are cardinal numbers, and a + 1 = b + 1, then a = b.</p>

<p>vi. If a is a cardinal number, then a + 1 &ne; 0.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that (iv) is the familar principle of mathematical
induction. Peano in an historical note refers its first
explicit employment, although without a general enunciation, to
Maurolycus in his work, <i>Arithmeticorum libri duo</i> (Venice, 1575).</p>

<p>But now the difficulty of confining mathematics to being the
science of number and quantity is immediately apparent. For
there is no self-contained science of cardinal numbers. The proof
of the six premisses requires an elaborate investigation into the
general properties of classes and relations which can be deduced
by the strictest reasoning from our ultimate logical principles.
Also it is purely arbitrary to erect the consequences of these six
principles into a separate science. They are excellent principles
of the highest value, but they are in no sense the necessary premisses
which must be proved before any other propositions of
cardinal numbers can be established. On the contrary, the premisses
of arithmetic can be put in other forms, and, furthermore,
an indefinite number of propositions of arithmetic can be proved
directly from logical principles without mentioning them. Thus,
while arithmetic may be defined as that branch of deductive reasoning
concerning classes and relations which is concerned with the
establishment of propositions concerning cardinal numbers, it must
be added that the introduction of cardinal numbers makes no great
break in this general science. It is no more than an interesting
subdivision in a general theory.</p>

<p><i>Ordinal Numbers.</i>&mdash;We must first understand what is meant by
&ldquo;order,&rdquo; that is, by &ldquo;serial arrangement.&rdquo; An order of a set of
things is to be sought in that relation holding between members
of the set which constitutes that order. The set viewed as a class
has many orders. Thus the telegraph posts along a certain road
have a space-order very obvious to our senses; but they have also
a time-order according to dates of erection, perhaps more important
to the postal authorities who replace them after fixed intervals.
A set of cardinal numbers have an order of magnitude, often called
<i>the</i> order of the set because of its insistent obviousness to us; but,
if they are the numbers drawn in a lottery, their time-order of
occurrence in that drawing also ranges them in an order of some
importance. Thus the order is defined by the &ldquo;serial&rdquo; relation.
A relation (R) is serial<a name="fa4u" id="fa4u" href="#ft4u"><span class="sp">4</span></a> when (1) it implies diversity, so that, if
x has the relation R to y, x is diverse from y; (2) it is transitive, so
that if x has the relation R to y, and y to z, then x has the relation
R to z; (3) it has the property of connexity, so that if x and y are
things to which any things bear the relation R, or which bear the
relation R to any things, then <i>either</i> x is identical with y, <i>or</i> x has
the relation R to y, <i>or</i> y has the relation R to x. These conditions
are necessary and sufficient to secure that our ordinary ideas of
&ldquo;preceding&rdquo; and &ldquo;succeeding&rdquo; hold in respect to the relation R.
The &ldquo;field&rdquo; of the relation R is the class of things ranged in order
by it. Two relations R and R&prime; are said to be ordinally similar, if
a one-one relation holds between the members of the two fields
of R and R&prime;, such that if x and y are any two members of the field
of R, such that x has the relation R to y, and if x&prime; and y&prime; are the
correlates in the field of R&prime; of x and y, then in all such cases x&prime; has
the relation R&prime; to y&prime;, and conversely, interchanging the dashes on
the letters, <i>i.e.</i> R and R&prime;, x and x&prime;, &amp;c. It is evident that the ordinal
similarity of two relations implies the cardinal similarity of their
fields, but not conversely. Also, two relations need not be serial
in order to be ordinally similar; but if one is serial, so is the other.
The relation-number of a relation is the class whose members are
all those relations which are ordinally similar to it. This class will
include the original relation itself. The relation-number of a relation
should be compared with the cardinal number of a class. When a
relation is serial its relation-number is often called its serial type.
The addition and multiplication of two relation-numbers is defined
by taking two relations R and S, such that (1) their fields have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page880" id="page880"></a>880</span>
terms in common; (2) their relation-numbers are the two relation-numbers
in question, and then by defining by reference to R and
S two other suitable relations whose relation-numbers are defined
to be respectively the sum and product of the relation-numbers in
question. We need not consider the details of this process. Now
if n be any finite cardinal number, it can be proved that the class
of those serial relations, which have a field whose cardinal number
is n, is a relation-number. This relation-number is the ordinal
number corresponding to n; let it be symbolized by n&#775; Thus,
corresponding to the cardinal numbers 2, 3, 4 ... there are the
ordinal numbers 2&#775;, 3&#775;, 4&#775;.... The definition of the ordinal number 1
requires some little ingenuity owing to the fact that no serial
relation can have a field whose cardinal number is 1; but we must
omit here the explanation of the process. The ordinal number 0&#775;
is the class whose sole member is the null relation&mdash;that is, the
relation which never holds between any pair of entities. The definitions
of the finite ordinals can be expressed without use of the
corresponding cardinals, so there is no essential priority of cardinals
to ordinals. Here also it can be seen that the science of the finite
ordinals is a particular subdivision of the general theory of classes
and relations. Thus the illusory nature of the traditional definition
of mathematics is again illustrated.</p>

<p><i>Cantor&rsquo;s Infinite Numbers.</i>&mdash;Owing to the correspondence between
the finite cardinals and the finite ordinals, the propositions of
cardinal arithmetic and ordinal arithmetic correspond point by
point. But the definition of the cardinal number of a class applies
when the class is not finite, and it can be proved that there are
different infinite cardinal numbers, and that there is a least infinite
cardinal, now usually denoted by &#1488;<span class="su">0</span>, where &#1488; is the Hebrew
letter aleph. Similarly, a class of serial relations, called <i>well-ordered</i>
serial relations, can be defined, such that their corresponding
relation-numbers include the ordinary finite ordinals, but also
include relation-numbers which have many properties like those
of the finite ordinals, though the fields of the relations belonging
to them are not finite. These relation-numbers are the infinite ordinal
numbers. The arithmetic of the infinite cardinals does not correspond
to that of the infinite ordinals. The theory of these extensions
of the ideas of number is dealt with in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Number</a></span>. It will
suffice to mention here that Peano&rsquo;s fourth premiss of arithmetic
does not hold for infinite cardinals or for infinite ordinals. Contrasting
the above definitions of number, cardinal and ordinals, with
the alternative theory that number is an ultimate idea incapable of
definition, we notice that our procedure exacts a greater attention,
combined with a smaller credulity; for every idea, assumed as
ultimate, demands a separate act of faith.</p>

<p><i>The Data of Analysts.</i>&mdash;Rational numbers and real numbers in
general can now be defined according to the same general method,
If m and n are finite cardinal numbers, the rational number m/n is
the relation which any finite cardinal number x bears to any finite
cardinal number y when n × x = m × y. Thus the rational number
one, which we will denote by 1<span class="su">r</span>, is not the cardinal number 1;
for 1<span class="su">r</span> is the relation 1/1 as defined above, and is thus a relation
holding between certain pairs of cardinals. Similarly, the other
rational integers must be distinguished from the corresponding
cardinals. The arithmetic of rational numbers is now established
by means of appropriate definitions, which indicate the entities
meant by the operations of addition and multiplication. But
the desire to obtain general enunciations of theorems without
exceptional cases has led mathematicians to employ entities of
ever-ascending types of elaboration. These entities are not created
by mathematicians, they are employed by them, and their definitions
should point out the construction of the new entities in terms of
those already on hand. The real numbers, which include irrational
numbers, have now to be defined. Consider the serial arrangement
of the rationals in their order of magnitude. A real number is a
class (&alpha;, say) of rational numbers which satisfies the condition that
it is the same as the class of those rationals each of which precedes
at least one member of &alpha;. Thus, consider the class of rationals less
than 2<span class="su">r</span>; any member of this class precedes some other members
of the class&mdash;thus 1/2 precedes 4/3, 3/2 and so on; also the class of
predecessors of predecessors of 2<span class="su">r</span> is itself the class of predecessors
of 2<span class="su">r</span>. Accordingly this class is a real number; it will be called the
real number 2<span class="su">R</span>. Note that the class of rationals less than or equal
to 2<span class="su">r</span> is not a real number. For 2<span class="su">r</span> is not a predecessor of some
member of the class. In the above example 2<span class="su">R</span> is an integral real
number, which is distinct from a rational integer, and from a
cardinal number. Similarly, any rational real number is distinct
from the corresponding rational number. But now the irrational
real numbers have all made their appearance. For example, the
class of rationals whose squares are less than 2<span class="su">r</span> satisfies the definition
of a real number; it is the real number &radic;2. The arithmetic of real
numbers follows from appropriate definitions of the operations of
addition and multiplication. Except for the immediate purposes
of an explanation, such as the above, it is unnecessary for mathematicians
to have separate symbols, such as 2, 2<span class="su">r</span> and 2<span class="su">R</span>, or 2/3
and (2/3)<span class="su">R</span>. Real numbers with signs (+ or &minus;) are now defined.
If a is a real number, +a is defined to be the relation which any
real number of the form x + a bears to the real number x, and &minus;a is
the relation which any real number x bears to the real number
x + a. The addition and multiplication of these &ldquo;signed&rdquo; real
numbers is suitably defined, and it is proved that the usual arithmetic
of such numbers follows. Finally, we reach a complex
number of the nth order. Such a number is a &ldquo;one-many&rdquo; relation
which relates n signed real numbers (or n algebraic complex numbers
when they are already defined by this procedure) to the n cardinal
numbers 1, 2 ... n respectively. If such a complex number is
written (as usual) in the form x<span class="su">1</span>e<span class="su">1</span> + x<span class="su">2</span>e<span class="su">2</span> + ... + x<span class="su">n</span>e<span class="su">n</span>, then this particular
complex number relates x<span class="su">1</span> to 1, x<span class="su">2</span> to 2, ... x<span class="su">n</span> to n. Also
the &ldquo;unit&rdquo; e<span class="su">1</span> (or e<span class="su">2</span>) considered as a number of the system is merely
a shortened form for the complex number (+1) e<span class="su">1</span> + 0e<span class="su">2</span> + ... + 0e<span class="su">n</span>.
This last number exemplifies the fact that one signed real number,
such as 0, may be correlated to many of the n cardinals, such as
2 ... n in the example, but that each cardinal is only correlated
with one signed number. Hence the relation has been called above
&ldquo;one-many.&rdquo; The sum of two complex numbers x<span class="su">1</span>e<span class="su">1</span> + x<span class="su">2</span>e<span class="su">2</span> + ... + x<span class="su">n</span>e<span class="su">n</span>
and y<span class="su">1</span>e<span class="su">1</span> + y<span class="su">2</span>e<span class="su">2</span> + ... + y<span class="su">n</span>e<span class="su">n</span> is always defined to be the complex
number (x<span class="su">1</span> + y<span class="su">1</span>)e<span class="su">1</span> + (x<span class="su">2</span> + y<span class="su">2</span>)e<span class="su">2</span> + ... + (x<span class="su">n</span> + y<span class="su">n</span>)e<span class="su">n</span>. But an indefinite
number of definitions of the product of two complex
numbers yield interesting results. Each definition gives rise
to a corresponding algebra of higher complex numbers. We
will confine ourselves here to algebraic complex numbers&mdash;that
is, to complex numbers of the second order taken in
connexion with that definition of multiplication which leads to
ordinary algebra. The product of two complex numbers of the
second order&mdash;namely, x<span class="su">1</span>e<span class="su">1</span> + x<span class="su">2</span>e<span class="su">2</span> and y<span class="su">1</span>e<span class="su">1</span> + y<span class="su">2</span>e<span class="su">2</span>, is in this case
defined to mean the complex (x<span class="su">1</span>y<span class="su">1</span> - x<span class="su">2</span>y<span class="su">2</span>)e<span class="su">1</span> + (x<span class="su">1</span>y<span class="su">2</span> + x<span class="su">2</span>y<span class="su">1</span>)e<span class="su">2</span>. Thus
e<span class="su">1</span> × e<span class="su">1</span> = e, e<span class="su">2</span> × e<span class="su">2</span> = -e<span class="su">1</span>, e<span class="su">1</span> × e<span class="su">2</span> = e<span class="su">2</span> × e<span class="su">1</span> = e<span class="su">2</span>. With this definition
it is usual to omit the first symbol e<span class="su">1</span>, and to write i or &radic;&minus;1
instead of e<span class="su">2</span>. Accordingly, the typical form for such a complex
number is x + yi, and then with this notation the above-mentioned
definition of multiplication is invariably adopted. The importance
of this algebra arises from the fact that in terms of such complex
numbers with this definition of multiplication the utmost generality
of expression, to the exclusion of exceptional cases, can be obtained
for theorems which occur in analogous forms, but complicated with
exceptional cases, in the algebras of real numbers and of signed real
numbers. This is exactly the same reason as that which has led
mathematicians to work with signed real numbers in preference to
real numbers, and with real numbers in preference to rational
numbers. The evolution of mathematical thought in the invention
of the data of analysis has thus been completely traced in outline.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Definition of Mathematics.</i>&mdash;It has now become apparent that
the traditional field of mathematics in the province of discrete
and continuous number can only be separated from the general
abstract theory of classes and relations by a wavering and indeterminate
line. Of course a discussion as to the mere application
of a word easily degenerates into the most fruitless logomachy.
It is open to any one to use any word in any sense. But on the
assumption that &ldquo;mathematics&rdquo; is to denote a science well
marked out by its subject matter and its methods from other
topics of thought, and that at least it is to include all topics
habitually assigned to it, there is now no option but to employ
&ldquo;mathematics&rdquo; in the general sense<a name="fa5u" id="fa5u" href="#ft5u"><span class="sp">5</span></a> of the &ldquo;science concerned
with the logical deduction of consequences from the general
premisses of all reasoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Geometry.</i>&mdash;The typical mathematical proposition is: &ldquo;If
x, y, z ... satisfy such and such conditions, then such and such
other conditions hold with respect to them.&rdquo; By taking fixed
conditions for the hypothesis of such a proposition a definite
department of mathematics is marked out. For example,
geometry is such a department. The &ldquo;axioms&rdquo; of geometry
are the fixed conditions which occur in the hypotheses of the
geometrical propositions. The special nature of the &ldquo;axioms&rdquo;
which constitute geometry is considered in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geometry</a></span>
(<i>Axioms</i>). It is sufficient to observe here that they are concerned
with special types of classes of classes and of classes of relations,
and that the connexion of geometry with number and magnitude
is in no way an essential part of the foundation of the science. In
fact, the whole theory of measurement in geometry arises at a
comparatively late stage as the result of a variety of complicated
considerations.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Classes and Relations.</i>&mdash;The foregoing account of the nature of
mathematics necessitates a strict deduction of the general properties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page881" id="page881"></a>881</span>
of classes and relations from the ultimate logical premisses. In the
course of this process, undertaken for the first time with the rigour
of mathematicians, some contradictions have become apparent.
That first discovered is known as Burali-Forti&rsquo;s contradiction,<a name="fa6u" id="fa6u" href="#ft6u"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and
consists in the proof that there both is and is not a greatest infinite
ordinal number. But these contradictions do not depend upon
any theory of number, for Russell&rsquo;s contradiction<a name="fa7u" id="fa7u" href="#ft7u"><span class="sp">7</span></a> does not involve
number in any form. This contradiction arises from considering
the class possessing as members all classes which are not members
of themselves. Call this class w; then to say that x is a w is
equivalent to saying that x is not an x. Accordingly, to say that w
is a w is equivalent to saying that w is not a w. An analogous
contradiction can be found for relations. It follows that a careful
scrutiny of the very idea of classes and relations is required.
Note that classes are here required in extension, so that the class of
human beings and the class of rational featherless bipeds are
identical; similarly for relations, which are to be determined by the
entities related. Now a class in respect to its components is many.
In what sense then can it be one? This problem of &ldquo;the one and the
many&rdquo; has been discussed continuously by the philosophers.<a name="fa8u" id="fa8u" href="#ft8u"><span class="sp">8</span></a> All
the contradictions can be avoided, and yet the use of classes and
relations can be preserved as required by mathematics, and indeed
by common sense, by a theory which denies to a class&mdash;or relation&mdash;existence
or being in any sense in which the entities composing it&mdash;or
related by it&mdash;exist. Thus, to say that a pen is an entity and the
class of pens is an entity is merely a play upon the word &ldquo;entity&rdquo;;
the second sense of &ldquo;entity&rdquo; (if any) is indeed derived from the
first, but has a more complex signification. Consider an incomplete
proposition, incomplete in the sense that some entity which ought
to be involved in it is represented by an undetermined x, which may
stand for any entity. Call it a propositional function; and, if &phi;x
be a propositional function, the undetermined variable x is the
argument. Two propositional functions &phi;x and &psi;x are &ldquo;extensionally
identical&rdquo; if any determination of x in &phi;x which converts
&phi;x into a true proposition also converts &psi;x into a true proposition,
and conversely for &psi; and &phi;. Now consider a propositional function
F<span class="su">&chi;</span> in which the variable argument &chi; is itself a propositional function.
If F<span class="su">&chi;</span> is true when, and only when, &chi; is determined to be either &phi; or
some other propositional function extensionally equivalent to &phi;,
then the proposition F<span class="su">&phi;</span> is of the form which is ordinarily recognized
as being about the class determined by &phi;x taken in extension&mdash;that
is, the class of entities for which &phi;x is a true proposition when x is
determined to be any one of them. A similar theory holds for relations
which arise from the consideration of propositional functions with
two or more variable arguments. It is then possible to define
by a parallel elaboration what is meant by classes of classes,
classes of relations, relations between classes, and so on. Accordingly,
the number of a class of relations can be defined, or of a class
of classes, and so on. This theory<a name="fa9u" id="fa9u" href="#ft9u"><span class="sp">9</span></a> is in effect a theory of the <i>use</i>
of classes and relations, and does not decide the philosophic question
as to the sense (if any) in which a class in extension is one entity.
It does indeed deny that it is an entity in the sense in which one of
its members is an entity. Accordingly, it is a fallacy for any
determination of x to consider &ldquo;x is an x&rdquo; or &ldquo;x is not an x&rdquo; as
having the meaning of propositions. Note that for any determination
of x, &ldquo;x is an x&rdquo; and &ldquo;x is not an x,&rdquo; are neither of them
fallacies but are both meaningless, according to this theory. Thus
Russell&rsquo;s contradiction vanishes, and an examination of the other
contradictions shows that they vanish also.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Applied Mathematics.</i>&mdash;The selection of the topics of mathematical
inquiry among the infinite variety open to it has been
guided by the useful applications, and indeed the abstract theory
has only recently been disentangled from the empirical elements
connected with these applications. For example, the application
of the theory of cardinal numbers to classes of physical entities
involves in practice some process of counting. It is only recently
that the <i>succession</i> of processes which is involved in any act of
counting has been seen to be irrelevant to the idea of number.
Indeed, it is only by experience that we can know that any
definite process of counting will give the true cardinal number
of some class of entities. It is perfectly possible to imagine a
universe in which any act of counting by a being in it annihilated
some members of the class counted during the time and only
during the time of its continuance. A legend of the Council of
Nicea<a name="fa10u" id="fa10u" href="#ft10u"><span class="sp">10</span></a> illustrates this point: &ldquo;When the Bishops took their
places on their thrones, they were 318; when they rose up to be
called over, it appeared that they were 319; so that they never
could make the number come right, and whenever they approached
the last of the series, he immediately turned into the likeness of
his next neighbour.&rdquo; Whatever be the historical worth of this
story, it may safely be said that it cannot be disproved by deductive
reasoning from the premisses of abstract logic. The most
we can do is to assert that a universe in which such things are
liable to happen on a large scale is unfitted for the practical
application of the theory of cardinal numbers. The application
of the theory of real numbers to physical quantities involves
analogous considerations. In the first place, some physical
process of addition is presupposed, involving some inductively
inferred law of permanence during that process. Thus in the
theory of masses we must know that two pounds of lead when
put together will counterbalance in the scales two pounds of
sugar, or a pound of lead and a pound of sugar. Furthermore,
the sort of continuity of the series (in order of magnitude) of
rational numbers is known to be different from that of the series
of real numbers. Indeed, mathematicians now reserve &ldquo;continuity&rdquo;
as the term for the latter kind of continuity; the mere
property of having an infinite number of terms between any two
terms is called &ldquo;compactness.&rdquo; The compactness of the series
of rational numbers is consistent with quasi-gaps in it&mdash;that is,
with the possible absence of limits to classes in it. Thus the
class of rational numbers whose squares are less than 2 has no
upper limit among the rational numbers. But among the
real numbers all classes have limits. Now, owing to the necessary
inexactness of measurement, it is impossible to discriminate
directly whether any kind of continuous physical quantity
possesses the compactness of the series of rationals or the continuity
of the series of real numbers. In calculations the latter
hypothesis is made because of its mathematical simplicity. But,
the assumption has certainly no a priori grounds in its favour,
and it is not very easy to see how to base it upon experience.
For example, if it should turn out that the mass of a body is to
be estimated by counting the number of corpuscles (whatever
they may be) which go to form it, then a body with an irrational
measure of mass is intrinsically impossible. Similarly, the
continuity of space apparently rests upon sheer assumption
unsupported by any a priori or experimental grounds. Thus
the current applications of mathematics to the analysis of
phenomena can be justified by no a priori necessity.</p>

<p>In one sense there is no science of applied mathematics.
When once the fixed conditions which any hypothetical group
of entities are to satisfy have been precisely formulated, the
deduction of the further propositions, which also will hold respecting
them, can proceed in complete independence of the question
as to whether or no any such group of entities can be found in
the world of phenomena. Thus rational mechanics, based on
the Newtonian Laws, viewed as mathematics is independent of
its supposed application, and hydrodynamics remains a coherent
and respected science though it is extremely improbable that
any perfect fluid exists in the physical world. But this unbendingly
logical point of view cannot be the last word upon the
matter. For no one can doubt the essential difference between
characteristic treatises upon &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and &ldquo;applied&rdquo; mathematics.
The difference is a difference in method. In pure mathematics
the hypotheses which a set of entities are to satisfy are given, and
a group of interesting deductions are sought. In &ldquo;applied
mathematics&rdquo; the &ldquo;deductions&rdquo; are given in the shape of the
experimental evidence of natural science, and the hypotheses
from which the &ldquo;deductions&rdquo; can be deduced are sought.
Accordingly, every treatise on applied mathematics, properly
so-called, is directed to the criticism of the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; from which
the reasoning starts, or to a suggestion of results which experiment
may hope to find. Thus if it calculates the result of some
experiment, it is not the experimentalist&rsquo;s well-attested results
which are on their trial, but the basis of the calculation.
Newton&rsquo;s <i>Hypotheses non fingo</i> was a proud boast, but it rests
upon an entire misconception of the capacities of the mind of
man in dealing with external nature.</p>

<p>This survey of the existing developments of pure mathematics
confirms the conclusions arrived at from the previous survey of
the theoretical principles of the subject. Functions, operations,
transformations, substitutions, correspondences, are but names for
various types of relations. A group is a class of relations possessing
a special property. Thus the modern ideas, which have so powerfully
extended and unified the subject, have loosened its connexion
with &ldquo;number&rdquo; and &ldquo;quantity,&rdquo; while bringing ideas of form
and structure into increasing prominence. Number must indeed
ever remain the great topic of mathematical interest, because it is
in reality the great topic of applied mathematics. All the world,
including savages who cannot count beyond five, daily &ldquo;apply&rdquo;
theorems of number. But the complexity of the idea of number
is practically illustrated by the fact that it is best studied as a
department of a science wider than itself.</p>

(including dynamical astronomy) is that subject among those
traditionally classed as &ldquo;applied&rdquo; which has been most completely
transfused by mathematics&mdash;that is to say, which is studied with
the deductive spirit of the pure mathematician, and not with the
covert inductive intention overlaid with the superficial forms of
deduction, characteristic of the applied mathematician.</p>

<p>Every branch of physics gives rise to an application of mathematics.
A prophecy may be hazarded that in the future these
applications will unify themselves into a mathematical theory of
a hypothetical substructure of the universe, uniform under all the
diverse phenomena. This reflection is suggested by the following
articles: <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aether</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molecule</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Capillary Action</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffusion</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Radiation, Theory of</a></span>; and others.</p>

<p>The applications of mathematics to statistics (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Statistics</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Probability</a></span>) should not be lost sight of; the leading fields for
these applications are insurance, sociology, variation in zoology and
economics.</p>

<p><i>The History of Mathematics.</i>&mdash;The history of mathematics
is in the main the history of its various branches. A short
account of the history of each branch will be found in connexion
with the article which deals with it. Viewing the subject as a
whole, and apart from remote developments which have not in
fact seriously influenced the great structure of the mathematics
of the European races, it may be said to have had its origin with
the Greeks, working on pre-existing fragmentary lines of thought
derived from the Egyptians and Ph&oelig;nicians. The Greeks
created the sciences of geometry and of number as applied to the
measurement of continuous quantities. The great abstract ideas
(considered directly and not merely in tacit use) which have
dominated the science were due to them&mdash;namely, ratio, irrationality,
continuity, the point, the straight line, the plane. This
period lasted<a name="fa11u" id="fa11u" href="#ft11u"><span class="sp">11</span></a> from the time of Thales, <i>c.</i> 600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, to the capture
of Alexandria by the Mahommedans, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 641. The medieval
Arabians invented our system of numeration and developed
algebra. The next period of advance stretches from the Renaissance
to Newton and Leibnitz at the end of the 17th century.
During this period logarithms were invented, trigonometry and
algebra developed, analytical geometry invented, dynamics
put upon a sound basis, and the period closed with the magnificent
invention of (or at least the perfecting of) the differential
calculus by Newton and Leibnitz and the discovery of gravitation.
The 18th century witnessed a rapid development of analysis,
and the period culminated with the genius of Lagrange and
Laplace. This period may be conceived as continuing throughout
the first quarter of the 19th century. It was remarkable both
for the brilliance of its achievements and for the large number
of French mathematicians of the first rank who flourished during
it. The next period was inaugurated in analysis by K. F. Gauss,
N. H. Abel and A. L. Cauchy. Between them the general
theory of the complex variable, and of the various &ldquo;infinite&rdquo;
processes of mathematical analysis, was established, while other
mathematicians, such as Poncelet, Steiner, Lobatschewsky and
von Staudt, were founding modern geometry, and Gauss inaugurated
the differential geometry of surfaces. The applied
mathematical sciences of light, electricity and electromagnetism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page883" id="page883"></a>883</span>
and of heat, were now largely developed. This school of mathematical
thought lasted beyond the middle of the century, after
which a change and further development can be traced. In the
next and last period the progress of pure mathematics has been
dominated by the critical spirit introduced by the German
mathematicians under the guidance of Weierstrass, though foreshadowed
by earlier analysts, such as Abel. Also such ideas as
those of invariants, groups and of form, have modified the
entire science. But the progress in all directions has been too
rapid to admit of any one adequate characterization. During
the same period a brilliant group of mathematical physicists,
notably Lord Kelvin (W. Thomson), H. V. Helmholtz, J. C.
Maxwell, H. Hertz, have transformed applied mathematics by
systematically basing their deductions upon the Law of the
conservation of energy, and the hypothesis of an ether pervading
space.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography.</span>&mdash;References to the works containing expositions
of the various branches of mathematics are given in the appropriate
articles. It must suffice here to refer to sources in which the subject
is considered as one whole. Most philosophers refer in their works
to mathematics more or less cursorily, either in the treatment of
the ideas of number and magnitude, or in their consideration of the
alleged a priori and necessary truths. A bibliography of such
references would be in effect a bibliography of metaphysics, or
rather of epistemology. The founder of the modern point of view,
explained in this article, was Leibnitz, who, however, was so far
in advance of contemporary thought that his ideas remained
neglected and undeveloped until recently; cf. <i>Opuscules et fragments
inédits de Leibnitz. Extraits des manuscrits de la bibliothèque
royale de Hanovre</i>, by Louis Couturat (Paris, 1903), especially
pp. 356-399, &ldquo;Generales inquisitiones de analysi notionum et
veritatum&rdquo; (written in 1686); also cf. <i>La Logique de Leibnitz</i>, already
referred to. For the modern authors who nave rediscovered and
improved upon the position of Leibnitz, cf. <i>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik,
begriffsschriftlich abgeleitet von Dr G. Frege, a.o. Professor
an der Univ. Jena</i> (Bd. i., 1893; Bd. ii., 1903, Jena); also cf. Frege&rsquo;s
earlier works, <i>Begriffsschrift, eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete
Formelsprache des reinen Denkens</i> (Halle, 1879), and <i>Die Grundlagen
der Arithmetik</i> (Breslau, 1884); also cf. Bertrand Russell, <i>The
Principles of Mathematics</i> (Cambridge, 1903), and his article on
&ldquo;Mathematical Logic&rdquo; in <i>Amer. Quart. Journ. of Math.</i> (vol. xxx.,
1908). Also the following works are of importance, though not all
expressly expounding the Leibnitzian point of view: cf. G. Cantor,
&ldquo;Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre,&rdquo; <i>Math.
Annal.</i>, vol. xxi. (1883) and subsequent articles in vols. xlvi. and xlix.;
also R. Dedekind, <i>Stetigkeit und irrationales Zahlen</i> (1st ed., 1872),
and <i>Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?</i> (1st ed., 1887), both tracts
translated into English under the title <i>Essays on the Theory of
Numbers</i> (Chicago, 1901). These works of G. Cantor and Dedekind
were of the greatest importance in the progress of the subject.

<p><span class="bold">MATHER, COTTON<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> (1663-1728), American Congregational
clergyman and author, was born in Boston, Massachusetts,
on the 12th of February 1663. He was the grandson of Richard
Mather, and the eldest child of Increase Mather (<i>q.v.</i>), and
Maria, daughter of John Cotton. After studying under the
famous Ezekiel Cheever (1614-1708), he entered Harvard
College at twelve, and graduated in 1678. While teaching
(1678-1685), he began the study of theology, but soon, on account
of an impediment in his speech, discontinued it and took up medicine.
Later, however, he conquered the difficulty and finished his
preparation for the ministry. He was elected assistant pastor
in his father&rsquo;s church, the North, or Second, Church of Boston,
in 1681 and was ordained as his father&rsquo;s colleague in 1685.
In 1688, when his father went to England as agent for the colony,
he was left at twenty-five in charge of the largest congregation
in New England, and he ministered to it for the rest of his life.
He soon became one of the most influential men in the colonies.
He had much to do with the witchcraft persecution of his day;
in 1692 when the magistrates appealed to the Boston clergy
for advice in regard to the witchcraft cases in Salem he drafted
their reply, upon which the prosecutions were based; in 1689
he had written <i>Memorable Providences Relating to Witchcraft
and Possessions</i>, and even his earlier diaries have many entries
showing his belief in diabolical possession and his fear and hatred
of it. Thinking as he did that the New World had been the
undisturbed realm of Satan before the settlements were made
in Massachusetts, he considered it natural that the Devil should
make a peculiar effort to bring moral destruction on these
godly invaders. He used prayer and fasting to deliver himself
from evil enchantment; and when he saw ecstatic and mystical
visions promising him the Lord&rsquo;s help and great usefulness
in the Lord&rsquo;s work, he feared that these revelations might be of
diabolic origin. He used his great influence to bring the suspected
persons to trial and punishment. He attended the trials,
investigated many of the cases himself, and wrote sermons on
witchcraft, the <i>Memorable Providences</i> and <i>The Wonders of the
Invisible World</i> (1693), which increased the excitement of
the people. Accordingly, when the persecutions ceased and the
reaction set in, much of the blame was laid upon him; the
influence of Judge Samuel Sewall, after he had come to think
his part in the Salem delusion a great mistake, was turned
against the Mathers; and the liberal leaders of Congregationalism
in Boston, notably the Brattles, found this a vulnerable point
in Cotton Mather&rsquo;s armour and used their knowledge to much
effect, notably by assisting Robert Calef (d. <i>c.</i> 1723) in the
preparation of <i>More Wonders of the Invisible World</i> (1700) a
powerful criticism of Cotton Mather&rsquo;s part in the delusion at
Salem.</p>

<p>Mather took some part as adviser in the Revolution of 1689
in Massachusetts. In 1690 he became a member o£ the Corporation
(probably the youngest ever chosen as Fellow) of Harvard
College, and in 1707 he was greatly disappointed at his failure
to be chosen president of that institution. He received the
degree of D.D. from the University of Glasgow in 1710, and
in 1713 was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. Like his
father he was deeply grieved by the liberal theology and Church
polity of the new Brattle Street Congregation, and conscientiously
opposed its pastor Benjamin Colman, who had been irregularly
ordained in England and by a Presbyterian body; but with
his father he took part in 1700 in services in Colman&rsquo;s church.
Harvard College was now controlled by the Liberals of the Brattle
Street Church, and as it grew farther and farther away from Calvinism,
Mather looked with increasing favour upon the college in
Connecticut; before September 1701 he had drawn up a &ldquo;scheme
for a college,&rdquo; the oldest document now in the Yale archives;
and finally (Jan. 1718) he wrote to a London merchant, Elihu
Yale, and persuaded him to make a liberal gift to the college,
which was named in his honour. During the small-pox epidemic
of 1721 he attempted in vain to have treatment by inoculation
employed, for the first time in America; and for this he was
bitterly attacked on all sides, and his life was at one time in
danger; but, nevertheless, he used the treatment on his son,
who recovered, and he wrote <i>An Account of the Method and
further Success of Inoculating for the Small Pox in London</i> (1721).
In addition he advocated temperance, missions, Bible societies,
and the education of the negro; favoured the establishing of
libraries for working men and of religious organizations for
young people, and organized societies for other branches of
philanthropic work. His later years were clouded with many
sorrows and disappointments; his relations with Governor
Joseph Dudley were unfriendly; he lost much of his former
prestige in the Church&mdash;his own congregation dwindled&mdash;and
in the college; his uncle John Cotton was expelled from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page884" id="page884"></a>884</span>
charge in the Plymouth Church; his son Increase turned out
a ne&rsquo;er-do-well; four of his children and his second wife died
in November 1713; his wife&rsquo;s brothers and the husbands of his
sisters were ungodly and violent men; his favourite daughter
Katherine, who &ldquo;understood Latin and read Hebrew fluently,&rdquo;
died in 1716; his third wife went mad in 1719; his personal
enemies circulated incredible scandals about him; and in 1724-1725
he saw a Liberal once more preferred to him as a new
president of Harvard. He died in Boston on the 13th of February
1728 and is buried in the Copps Hill burial-ground, Boston.
He was thrice married&mdash;to Abigail Phillips (d. 1702) in 1686,
to Mrs Elizabeth Hubbard (d. 1713) in 1703, and in 1715 to
Mrs Lydia George (d. 1734). Of his fifteen children only two
survived him.</p>

<p>Though self-conscious and vain, Cotton Mather had on the
whole a noble character. He believed strongly in the power
of prayer and repeatedly had assurances that his prayers were
heard; and when he was disappointed by non-fulfilment his
grief and depression were terrible. His spiritual nature was
high-strung and delicate; and this condition was aggravated
by his constant study, his long fasts and his frequent vigils&mdash;in
one year, according to his diary, he kept sixty fasts and twenty
vigils. In his later years his diaries have less and less of personal
detail, and repeated entries prefaced by the letters &ldquo;G.D.&rdquo;
meaning Good Device, embodying precepts of kindliness and
practical Christianity. He was remarkable for his godliness,
his enthusiasm for knowledge, and his prodigious memory.
He became a skilled linguist, a widely read scholar&mdash;though
much of his learning was more curious than useful&mdash;a powerful
preacher, a valued citizen, and a voluminous writer, and did
a vast deal for the intellectual and spiritual quickening of New
England. He worked with might and main for the continuation
of the old theocracy, but before he died it had given way before
an increasing Liberalism&mdash;even Yale was infected with the
Episcopalianism that he hated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among his four hundred or more published works, many of which
are sermons, tracts and letters, the most notable is his <i>Magnalia
Christi Americana: or the Ecclesiastical History of New England,
from Its First Planting in the Year 1620 unto the Year of Our Lord,
1698</i>. Begun in 1693 and finished in 1697, this work was published
in London, in 1702, in one volume, and was republished in Hartford
in 1820 and in 1853-1855, in two volumes. It is in seven books
and concerns itself mainly with the settlement and religious history
of New England. It is often inaccurate, and it abounds in far-fetched
conceits and odd and pedantic features. Its style, though
in the main rather unnatural and declamatory, is at its best spontaneous,
dignified and rhythmical; the book is valuable for occasional
facts and for its picture of the times, and it did much to make
Mather the most eminent American writer of his day. His other
writings include <i>A Poem Dedicated to the Memory of the Reverend
and Excellent Mr Urian Oakes</i> (1682); <i>The Present State of New
England</i> (1690); <i>The Life of the Renowned John Eliot</i> (1691), later
included in Book III. of the <i>Magnalia; The Short History of New
England</i> (1694); <i>Bonifacius</i>, usually known as <i>Essays To Do Good</i>
(Boston, 1710; Glasgow, 1825; Boston, 1845), one of his principal
books and one which had a shaping influence on the life of Benjamin
Franklin; <i>Psalterium Americanum</i> (1718), a blank verse translation
of the Psalms from the original Hebrew; <i>The Christian Philosopher:
A Collection of the Best Discoveries in Nature, with Religious Improvements</i>
(1721); <i>Parentator</i> (1724), a memoir of his father; <i>Ratio
Disciplinae</i> (1726), an account of the discipline in New England
churches; <i>Manuductio ad Ministerium: Directions for a Candidate
of the Ministry</i> (1726), one of the most readable of his books. He
also left a number of works in manuscript, including diaries, a
medical treatise and a huge commentary on the Bible, entitled
&ldquo;Biblia Americana.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHER, INCREASE<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1639-1723), American Congregational
minister, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on the 21st
of June 1639, the youngest son of Richard Mather.<a name="fa1v" id="fa1v" href="#ft1v"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He
entered Harvard in 1651, and graduated in 1656. In 1657, on
his eighteenth birthday, he preached his first sermon; in the
same year he went to visit his eldest brother in Dublin, and
studied there at Trinity College, where he graduated M.A. in
1658. He was chaplain to the English garrison at Guernsey
in April-December 1659 and again in 1661; and in the latter
year, refusing valuable livings in England offered on condition
of conformity, he returned to America. In the winter of 1661-1662
he began to preach to the Second (or North) Church of
Boston, and was ordained there on the 27th of May 1664. As
a delegate from Dorchester, his father&rsquo;s church, to the Synod
of 1662, he opposed the Half-Way Covenant adopted by the
Synod and defended by Richard Mather and by Jonathan
Mitchell (1624-1668) of Cambridge; but soon afterwards he
&ldquo;surrendered a glad captive&rdquo; to &ldquo;the truth so victoriously
cleared by Mr Mitchell,&rdquo; and like his father and his son became
one of the chief exponents of the Half-Way Covenant. He was
bitterly opposed, however, to the liberal practices that followed
the Half-Way Covenant and (after 1677) in particular to
&ldquo;Stoddardeanism,&rdquo; the doctrine of Solomon Stoddard (1643-1729)
that all &ldquo;such Persons as have a good Conversation and
a Competent Knowledge may come to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,&rdquo;
only those of openly immoral life being excluded. In May
1679 Mather was a petitioner to the General Court for the call
of a Synod to consider the reformation in New England of &ldquo;the
Evils that have Provoked the Lord to bring his Judgments,&rdquo;<a name="fa2v" id="fa2v" href="#ft2v"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
and when the &ldquo;Reforming Synod&rdquo; met in September it appointed
him one of a committee to draft a creed; this committee reported
in May 1680, at the Synod&rsquo;s second session, of which Mather
was moderator, the Savoy Declaration (slightly modified,
notably in ch. xxiv., &ldquo;Of the Civil Magistrate&rdquo;), which was
approved but was not made mandatory on the churches by
the General Court, and in 1708 was reaffirmed at Saybrook,
Connecticut. With the Cambridge Platform of 1646, drafted by
his father, the Confession of 1680, for which Increase Mather
was largely responsible, was printed as a book of doctrine and
government for the churches of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>After the threat of a <i>Quo Warranto</i> writ in 1683 for the
surrender of the Massachusetts charter, Mather used all his
tremendous influence to persuade the colonists not to give
up the charter; and the Boston freemen unanimously voted
against submission. The royal agents immediately afterwards
sent to London a treasonable letter, falsely attributed to Mather;
but its spuriousness seems to have been suspected in England and
Mather was not &ldquo;fetch&rsquo;d over and made a Sacrifice.&rdquo; He
became a leader in the opposition to Sir Edmund Andros, to
his secretary Edward Randolph, and to Governor Joseph
Dudley. He was chosen by the General Court to represent
the colony&rsquo;s interests in England, eluded officers sent to arrest
him,<a name="fa3v" id="fa3v" href="#ft3v"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and in disguise boarded a ship on which he reached
Weymouth on the 6th of May 1688. In London he acted
with Sir Henry Ashurst, the resident agent, and had two or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page885" id="page885"></a>885</span>
three fruitless audiences with James II. His first audience
with William III. was on the 9th of January 1689; he was active
in influencing the Commons to vote (1689) that the New England
charters should be restored; and he published <i>A Narrative
of the Miseries of New-England, By Reason of an Arbitrary
Government Erected there Under Sir Edmund Andros</i> (1688),
<i>A Brief Relation for the Confirmation of Charter Privileges</i> (1691),
and other pamphlets. In 1690 he was joined by Elisha Cooke
(1638-1715) and Thomas Oakes (1644-1719), additional agents,
who were uncompromisingly for the renewal of the old charter.
Mather, however, was instrumental in securing a new charter
(signed on Oct. 7, 1691), and prevented the annexation of the
Plymouth Colony to New York. The nomination of officers
left to the Crown was reserved to the agents. Mather had
expressed strong dissatisfaction with the clause giving the
governor the right of veto, and regretted the less theocratic
tone of the charter which made all freemen (and not merely
church members) electors. With Sir William Phips, the new
governor, a member of Mather&rsquo;s church, he arrived in Boston
on the 14th of May 1692. The value of his services to the
colony at this time is not easily over-estimated. In England
he won the friendship of divines like Baxter, Tillotson and
Burnet, and effectively promoted the union in 1691 of English
Presbyterians and Congregationalists. He was at heavy
expense throughout his stay, and even greater than his financial
loss was his loss of authority and control in the church and in
Harvard College because of his absence.</p>

<p>Mather had been acting president of Harvard College in
1681-1682, and in June 1685 he again became acting president
(or rector), but still preached every Sunday in Boston and would
not comply with an order of the General Court that he should
reside in Cambridge. In 1701 after a short residence there
he returned to Boston and wrote to the General Court to &ldquo;think
of another President for the Colledge.&rdquo; The opposition to him
had been increasing in strength, his resignation was accepted,
and Samuel Willard took charge of the college as vice-president,
although he also refused to reside in Cambridge. That Mather&rsquo;s
administration of the college was excellent is admitted even
by his harsh critic, Josiah Quincy, in his <i>History of Harvard
University</i>.<a name="fa4v" id="fa4v" href="#ft4v"><span class="sp">4</span></a> The Liberal party, which now came into control
in the college repeatedly disappointed the hopes of Cotton
Mather (<i>q.v.</i>) that he might be chosen president, and by its
ecclesiastical laxness and its broader views of Church polity
forced the Mathers to turn from Harvard to Yale as a truer
school of the prophets.</p>

<p>The Liberal leaders, John Leverett (1662-1724), William
Brattle (1662-1713)&mdash;who graduated with Leverett in 1680,
and with him as tutor controlled the college during Increase
Mather&rsquo;s absence in England&mdash;William Brattle&rsquo;s eldest brother,
Thomas Brattle (1658-1713), and Ebenezer Pemberton (1671-1717),
pastor of the Old South Church, desired an &ldquo;enrichment
of the service,&rdquo; and greater liberality in the matter of baptism.
In 1697 the Second Boston Church, in which Cotton Mather
had been his father&rsquo;s colleague since 1685, upbraided the Charlestown
Church &ldquo;for betraying the liberties of the churches in
their late putting into the hands of the whole inhabitants
the choice of a minister.&rdquo; In 1699 Increase Mather published
<i>The Order of the Gospel</i>, which severely (although indirectly),
criticized the methods of the &ldquo;Liberals&rdquo; in establishing the
Brattle Street Church and especially the ordination of their
minister Benjamin Colman by a Presbyterian body in London;
the Liberals replied with <i>The Gospel Order Revived</i>, which was
printed in New York to lend colour to the (partly true) charge
of its authors that the printers of Massachusetts would print
nothing hostile to Increase Mather.<a name="fa5v" id="fa5v" href="#ft5v"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The autocracy of the
Mathers in church, college, colony and press, had slipped from
them. The later years of Mather&rsquo;s life were spent almost entirely
in the work of the ministry, now beginning to be a less varied
career than when he entered on it. He died on the 23rd of
August 1723. He married in 1662 Maria, daughter of Sarah
and John Cotton. His first wife died in 1714; and in 1715 he
married Ann Lake, widow of John Cotton, of Hampton, N.H.,
a grandson of John Cotton of Boston.</p>

<p>Increase Mather was a great preacher with a simple style
and a splendid voice, which had a &ldquo;Tonitruous Cogency,&rdquo;
to quote his son&rsquo;s phrase. His style was much simpler and
more vernacular than his son&rsquo;s. He was an assiduous student,
commonly spending sixteen hours a day among his books; but
his learning (to quote Justin Winsor&rsquo;s contrast between Increase
and Cotton Mather) &ldquo;usually left his natural ability and his
education free from entanglements.&rdquo; He was not so much
self-seeking and personally ambitious as eager to advance the
cause of the church in which he so implicitly believed. That
it is a mistake to consider him a narrow churchman is shown
by his assisting in 1718 at the ordination of Elisha Callender
in the First Baptist Church of Boston. Like the most learned
men of his time he was superstitious and a firm believer in
&ldquo;praesagious impressions&rdquo;; his <i>Essay for the Recording of
Illustrious Providences: Wherein an Account is Given of many
Remarkable and very Memorable Events which have Hapned
in this Last Age, Especially in New England</i> (1684) shows that
he believed only less thoroughly than his son in witchcraft,
though in his <i>Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits</i> (1693)
he considered some current proofs of witchcraft inadequate. The
revulsion of feeling after the witchcraft delusion undermined
his authority greatly, and Robert&rsquo;s Calef&rsquo;s <i>More Wonders of the
Spiritual World</i> (1700) was a personal blow to him as well as
to his son. With Jonathan Edwards, than whom he was much
more of a man of affairs, and with Benjamin Franklin, whose
mission in England somewhat resembled Mather&rsquo;s, he may be
ranked among the greatest Americans of the period before the
War of Independence.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The first authority for the life of Increase Mather is the work of
his son Cotton Mather, <i>Parentator: Memoirs of Remarkables in the
Life and Death of the Ever Memorable Dr Increase Mather</i> (Boston,
1724); there are also a memoir and constant references in Cotton
Mather&rsquo;s <i>Magnalia</i> (London, 1702) especially vol. iv.; there is an
excellent sketch in the first volume of J. L. Sibley&rsquo;s <i>Biographical
Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University</i> (Cambridge, 1873), with
an exhaustive list of Mather&rsquo;s works (about 150 titles); there is
much valuable matter in Williston Walker&rsquo;s <i>Ten New England
Leaders</i> (New York, 1901) and in his <i>Creeds and Platforms of Congregationalism</i>
(New York, 1893); for literary criticism of the Mathers
see ch. xii. of M. C. Tyler&rsquo;s <i>History of American Literature,
1607-1676</i> (New York, 1878), and Barrett Wendell&rsquo;s <i>Cotton Mather</i>
(New York, 1891). Mather&rsquo;s worth has been under-estimated by
Josiah Quincy, Justin Winsor and other historians out of sympathy
with his ecclesiastical spirit, who represent him as only an ambitious
narrow-minded schemer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHER, RICHARD<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (1596-1669), American Congregational
clergyman, was born in Lowton, in the parish of Winwick,
near Liverpool, England, of a family which was in reduced circumstances
but entitled to bear a coat-of-arms. He studied at
Winwick grammar school, of which he was appointed a master in
his fifteenth year, and left it in 1612 to become master of a newly
established school at Toxteth Park, Liverpool. After a few
months at Brasenose College, Oxford, he began in November
1618 to preach at Toxteth, and was ordained there, possibly only
as deacon, early in 1619. In August-November 1633 he was
suspended for nonconformity in matters of ceremony; and in
1634 was again suspended by the visitors of Richard Neile,
archbishop of York, who, hearing that he had never worn a
surplice during the fifteen years of his ministry, refused to
reinstate him and said that &ldquo;it had been better for him that
he had gotten Seven Bastards.&rdquo; He had a great reputation
as a preacher in and about Liverpool; but, advised by letters
of John Cotton and Thomas Hooker, and persuaded by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page886" id="page886"></a>886</span>
own elaborate formal &ldquo;Arguments tending to prove the Removing
from Old-England to New ... to be not only lawful,
but also necessary for them that are not otherwise tyed, but
free,&rdquo; he left England and on the 17th of August 1635, and
landed in Boston after an &ldquo;extraordinary and miraculous
deliverance&rdquo; from a terrible storm. As a famous preacher
&ldquo;he was desired at Plimouth, Dorchester, and Roxbury.&rdquo; He
went to Dorchester, where the Church had been greatly depleted
by migrations to Windsor, Connecticut; and where, after a delay
of several months, in August 1636 there was constituted by
the consent of magistrates and clergy a church of which he was
&ldquo;teacher&rdquo; until his death in Dorchester on the 22nd of April
1669.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>He was an able preacher, &ldquo;aiming,&rdquo; said his biographer, &ldquo;to shoot
his arrows not over his people&rsquo;s heads, but into their Hearts and
Consciences&rdquo;; and he was a leader of New England Congregationalism,
whose policy he defended and described in the tract
<i>Church Government and Church Covenant Discussed, in an Answer
of the Elders of the Severall Churches of New England to Two and
Thirty Questions</i> (written 1639; printed 1643), and in his <i>Reply to
Mr Rutherford</i> (1647), a polemic against the Presbyterianism to which
the English Congregationalists were then tending. He drafted
the Cambridge Platform, an ecclesiastical constitution in seventeen
chapters, adopted (with the omission of Mather&rsquo;s paragraph favouring
the &ldquo;Half-way Covenant,&rdquo; of which he strongly approved) by
the general synod in August 1646. In 1657 he drafted the declaration
of the Ministerial Convention on the meaning and force of the
Half-way Covenant; this was published in 1659 under the title:
<i>A Disputation concerning Church Members and their Children in
Answer to XXI. Questions</i>. With Thomas Welde and John Eliot
he wrote the &ldquo;Bay Psalm Book,&rdquo; or, more accurately, <i>The Whole
Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre</i> (1640),
probably the first book printed in the English colonies.</p>
</div>

<p>He married in 1624 Katherine Hoult or Holt (d. 1655), and
secondly in 1656 Sarah Hankredge (d. 1676), the widow of John
Cotton. Of six sons, all by his first wife, four were ministers:
<span class="sc">Samuel</span> (1626-1671), the first fellow of Harvard College who
was a graduate, chaplain of Magdalen College, Oxford, in
1650-1653, and pastor (1656-1671, excepting suspension in
1660-1662) of St Nicholas&rsquo;s in Dublin; <span class="sc">Nathaniel</span> (1630-1697),
who graduated at Harvard in 1647, was vicar of Barnstaple,
Devon, in 1656-1662, pastor of the English Church in Rotterdam,

his death pastor of a church in London; <span class="sc">Eleazar</span> (1637-1669),
who graduated at Harvard in 1656 and after preaching in
Northampton, Massachusetts, for three years, became in 1661
pastor of the church there; and <span class="sc">Increase Mather</span> (<i>q.v.</i>). Horace
E. Mather, in his <i>Lineage of Richard Mather</i> (Hartford, Connecticut,

names, the more famous being Storrs and Schauffler.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHESON, GEORGE<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (1842-1906), Scottish theologian
and preacher, was born in Glasgow in 1842, the son of George
Matheson, a merchant. He was educated at the university
of Glasgow, where he graduated first in classics, logic and
philosophy. In his twentieth year he became totally blind,
but he held to his resolve to enter the ministry, and gave himself
to theological and historical study. His first ministry began
in 1868 at Innellan, on the Argyllshire coast between Dunoon
and Toward. His books on <i>Aids to the Study of German Theology,
Can the Old Faith live with the New? The Growth of the Spirit of
Christianity from the First Century to the Dawn of the Lutheran
Era</i>, established his reputation as a liberal and spiritually
minded theologian; and Queen Victoria invited him to preach
at Balmoral. In 1886 he removed to Edinburgh, where he
became minister of St Bernard&rsquo;s Parish Church. Here his
chief work as a preacher was done. In 1879 the university
of Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D.,
and the same year he declined an invitation to the pastorate
of Crown Court, London, in succession to Dr John Cumming
(1807-1881). In 1881 he was chosen as Baird lecturer, and
took for his subject &ldquo;Natural Elements of Revealed Theology,&rdquo;
and in 1882 he was the St Giles lecturer, his subject being
&ldquo;Confucianism.&rdquo; In 1890 he was elected a fellow of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, Aberdeen gave him its honorary LL.D.,
and in 1899 he was appointed Gifford lecturer by that university,
but declined on grounds of health. In the same year he severed
his active connexion with St Bernard&rsquo;s. One of his hymns,
&ldquo;O love that will not let me go,&rdquo; has passed into the popular
hymnology of the Christian Church. He died suddenly of
apoplexy on the 28th of August 1906. His exegesis owes its
interest to his subjective resources rather than to breadth of
learning; his power lay in spiritual vision rather than balanced
judgment, and in the vivid apprehension of the factors which
make the Christian personality, rather than in constructive
doctrinal statement.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHEW, THEOBALD<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (1790-1856), Irish temperance
reformer, popularly known as Father Mathew, was descended
from a branch of the Llandaff family, and was born at Thomastown,
Tipperary, on the 10th of October 1790. He received
his school education at Kilkenny, whence he passed for a short
time to Maynooth; from 1808 to 1814 he studied at Dublin, where
in the latter year he was ordained to the priesthood. Having
entered the Capuchin order, he, after a brief time of service
at Kilkenny, joined the mission in Cork, which was the scene of his
religious and benevolent labours for many years. The movement
with which his name is most intimately associated began in
1838 with the establishment of a total abstinence association,
which in less than nine months, thanks to his moral influence
and eloquence, enrolled no fewer than 150,000 names. It
rapidly spread to Limerick and elsewhere, and some idea of
its popularity may be formed from the fact that at Nenagh
20,000 persons are said to have taken the pledge in one day,
100,000 at Galway in two days, and 70,000 in Dublin in five days.
In 1844 he visited Liverpool, Manchester and London with
almost equal success. Meanwhile the expenses of his enterprise
had involved him in heavy liabilities, and led on one occasion
to his arrest for debt; from this embarrassment he was only
partially relieved by a pension of £300 granted by Queen Victoria
in 1847. In 1849 he paid a visit to the United States, returning
in 1851. He died at Queenstown on the 8th of December,
1856.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHEWS, CHARLES<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (1776-1835), English actor, was
born in London on the 28th of June 1776. His father was
&ldquo;a serious bookseller,&rdquo; who also officiated as minister in one
of Lady Huntingdon&rsquo;s chapels. Mathews was educated at
Merchant Taylors&rsquo; School. His love for the stage was formed
in his boyhood, when he was apprentice to his father, and the
latter in 1794 unwillingly permitted him to enter on a theatrical
engagement in Dublin. For several years Mathews had not
only to content himself with thankless parts at a low salary,
but in May 1803 he made his first London appearance at the
Haymarket as Jabel in Cumberland&rsquo;s <i>The Jew</i> and as Lingo
in <i>The Agreeable Surprise</i>. From this time his professional
career was an uninterrupted triumph. He had a wonderful
gift of mimicry, and could completely disguise his personality
without the smallest change of dress. The versatility and
originality of his powers were admirably displayed in his &ldquo;At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page887" id="page887"></a>887</span>
Homes,&rdquo; begun in the Lyceum theatre in 1818, which, according
to Leigh Hunt, &ldquo;for the richness and variety of his humour,
were as good as half a dozen plays distilled.&rdquo; Off the stage his
simple and kind-hearted disposition won him affection and
esteem. In 1822 Mathews visited America, his observation on
his experiences there forming for the reader a most entertaining
portion of his biography. From infancy his health had
been uncertain, and the toils of his profession gradually undermined
it. In 1834 he paid a second visit to America. His
last appearance in New York was on the 11th of February
1835, when he played Samuel Coddle in <i>Married Life</i> and
Andrew Steward in <i>The Lone House</i>. He died at Plymouth on
the 28th of June 1835. In 1797 he had married Eliza Kirkham
Strong (d. 1802), and in 1803 Anne Jackson, an actress, the
author of the popular and diverting <i>Memoirs, by Mrs Mathews</i>
(4 vols., 1838-1839).</p>

<p>His son <span class="sc">Charles James Mathews</span> (1803-1878), who was
born at Liverpool on the 26th of December 1803, became even
better known as an actor. After attending Merchant Taylors&rsquo;
School he was articled as pupil to an architect, and continued
for some years nominally to follow this profession. His first
public appearance on the stage was made on the 7th of December
1835, at the Olympic, London, as George Rattleton in his own
play <i>The Humpbacked Lover</i>, and as Tim Topple the Tiger
in Leman Rode&rsquo;s <i>Old and Young Stager</i>. In 1838 he married
Madame Vestris, then lessee of the Olympic, but neither his
management of this theatre, nor subsequently of Covent Garden,
nor of the Lyceum, resulted in pecuniary success, although
the introduction of scenery more realistic and careful in detail
than had hitherto been employed was due to his enterprise. In
the year of his marriage he visited America, but without receiving
a very cordial welcome. As an actor he held in England an
unrivalled place in his peculiar vein of light eccentric comedy.
The easy grace of his manner, and the imperturbable solemnity
with which he perpetrated his absurdities, never failed to charm
and amuse; his humour was never broad, but always measured
and restrained. It was as the leading character in such plays
as the <i>Game of Speculation</i>, <i>My Awful Dad</i>, <i>Cool as a Cucumber</i>,
<i>Patter versus Clatter</i>, and <i>Little Toddlekins</i>, that he specially
excelled. In 1856 Mme Vestris died, and in the following
year Mathews again visited the United States, where in 1858
he married Mrs A. H. Davenport. In 1861 they gave a series
of &ldquo;At Homes&rdquo; at the Haymarket theatre, which were almost
as popular as had been those of the elder Mathews. Charles
James Mathews was one of the few English actors who played
in French successfully,&mdash;his appearance in Paris in 1863 in a
French version of <i>Cool as a Cucumber</i>, written by himself, being
received with great approbation. He also played there again
in 1865 as Sir Charles Coldcream in the original play <i>L&rsquo;Homme
blasé</i> (English version by Boucicault, <i>Used up</i>). After reaching
his sixty-sixth year, Mathews set out on a tour round the world,
in which was included a third visit to America, and on his return
in 1872 he continued to act without interruption till within
a few weeks of his death on the 24th of June 1878. He made
his last appearance in New York at Wallack&rsquo;s theatre on the
7th of June 1872, in H. J. Byron&rsquo;s <i>Not such a Fool as he Looks</i>.
His last appearance in London was at the Opéra Comique on
the 2nd of June 1877, in <i>The Liar</i> and <i>The Cosy Couple</i>. At
Stalybridge he gave his last performance on the 8th of June
1878, when he played Adonis Evergreen in his own comedy
<i>My Awful Dad</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHEWS, THOMAS<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (1676-1751), British admiral, son of
Colonel Edward Mathews (d. 1700), and grandson on his mother&rsquo;s
side of Sir Thomas Armstrong (1624-1684), who was executed
for the Rye House Plot, was born at Llandaff Court, Llandaff.
He entered the navy and became lieutenant in 1699, being
promoted captain in 1703. During the short war with Spain
(1718-20) he commanded the &ldquo;Kent&rdquo; in the fleet of Sir
George Byng (Lord Torrington), and from 1722 to 1724 he had
the command of a small squadron sent to the East Indies to
repress the pirates of the coast of Malabar. He saw no further
service till March 1741, when he was appointed to the command
in the Mediterranean, and plenipotentiary to the king of Sardinia
and the other courts of Italy. It is impossible to understand
upon what grounds he was selected. As an admiral he was
not distinguished; he was quite destitute of the experience
and the tact required for his diplomatic duties; and he was
on the worst possible terms with his second in command,
Richard Lestock (1679?-1746). Yet the purpose for which
he was sent out in his double capacity was not altogether ill
performed. In 1742 Mathews sent a small squadron to Naples
to compel King Charles III., afterwards king of Spain, to remain
neutral. It was commanded by commodore, afterwards admiral,
William Martin (1696?-1756), who refused to enter into negotiations,
and gave the king half an hour in which to return an
answer. In June of the same year a squadron of Spanish
galleys, which had taken refuge in the Bay of Saint Tropez,
was burnt by the fireships of Mathews&rsquo; fleet. In the meantime
a Spanish squadron of line-of-battleships had taken refuge in
Toulon, and was watched by the British fleet from its anchorage
at Hyères. In February 1744 the Spaniards put to sea in
company with a French force. Mathews, who had now returned
to his flagship, followed, and an engagement took place on the
11th of February. The battle was highly discreditable to the
British fleet, and not very honourable to their opponents,
but it is of the highest historical importance in the history of the
navy. It marked the lowest pitch reached in discipline and
fighting and efficiency by the fleet in the 18th century, and it
had a very bad effect in confirming the pedantic system of tactics
set up by the old Fighting Instructions. The British fleet
followed the enemy in light winds on the 10th of February,
and became scattered. Mathews hoisted the signal to form
the line, and then when night fell, to lie to. At that moment
Lestock, who commanded in the rear, was at a considerable
distance from the body of the fleet, and he ought undoubtedly
to have joined his admiral before lying to, but he obeyed the
second order, with the result, which it is impossible not to feel
that he foresaw and desired, that when morning came he was
a long way off the flag of Mathews. The enemy were within
striking distance of the van and centre of the British fleet,
and Mathews attacked their rear. The battle was ill fought,
as it had been ill prepared. Lestock never came into action
at all. One Spanish line-of-battleship, the &ldquo;Poder&rdquo; (74),
was taken, but afterwards burnt. Several of the British
captains behaved very badly, and Mathews in a heat
of confused anger bore down on the enemy out of his line,
while the signal to keep the line was still flying at his mast
head. The French and Spaniards got away, and were not
pursued by Mathews, though they were of inferior strength.</p>

<p>Deep indignation was aroused at home by this naval miscarriage,
and the battle led to more than twenty courts-martial
and a parliamentary inquiry. The evils which had overrun
the navy were clearly displayed, and in so far some good was done.
It was shown for instance that one of the captains whose ship
behaved worst was a man of extreme age who was nearly blind
and deaf. One of the captains was so frightened at the prospect
of a trial that he deserted on his way home and disappeared
into Spain. Mathews resigned and returned home after the
battle. In consequence of the parliamentary motion for
inquiry, Lestock was brought to trial, and acquitted on the
ground that he had obeyed orders. Then Mathews was tried
in 1746, and was condemned to be dismissed the service on
the ground that he had not only failed to pursue the enemy
but had taken his fleet into action in a confused manner.
He had in fact not waited till he had his fleet in a line with the
enemy before bearing down on them, and he had disordered
his own line. To the country at large it appeared strange that
the admiral who had actually fought should be condemned,
while the admiral who had kept at a distance was acquitted.
Mathews looked upon his condemnation as the result of mere
party spirit. Sheer pedantry on the part of the officers forming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page888" id="page888"></a>888</span>
the court-martial affords a more satisfactory explanation. They
judged that a naval officer was bound not to go beyond the
Fighting Instructions as Mathews had undoubtedly done,
and therefore condemned him. Their decision had a serious
effect in fixing the rule that all battles, at any rate against
enemies of equal or nearly equal numbers, were to be fought
on one pattern. Mathews died on the 2nd of October 1751 in
London. There is a portrait of him in the Painted Hall at
Greenwich.</p>

by Montagu Burrows in his <i>Life of Hawke</i>. The French account
may be found in Tronde&rsquo;s <i>Batailles Navales de la France</i>. The
Spanish view is in the <i>Vida de Don Josef Navarro</i> by Don Josef de
Vargas. The battle led to a violent pamphlet controversy. The
charges and findings at the courts-martial on both Lestock and
Mathews were published at the time. The minor trials arising out of
the action are collected in a folio under the title &ldquo;Copies of all the
Minutes and Proceedings taken at and upon the several Tryals of
Captain George Burrish&rdquo; (1746). A &ldquo;Narrative&rdquo; was published
by, or for, Lestock in 1744, and answered by, or on behalf of, Mathews
under the title &ldquo;Ad&mdash;&mdash;l M&mdash;&mdash;w&rsquo;s Conduct in the late Engagement
Vindicated&rdquo; in 1745.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATHY, KARL<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (1807-1868), Badenese statesman, was born
at Mannheim on the 17th of March 1807. He studied law
and politics at Heidelberg, and entered the Baden government
department of finance in 1829. His sympathy with the revolutionary
ideas of 1830, expressed in his paper the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, cost
him his appointment in 1834, and he made his way to Switzerland,
where he contributed to the <i>Jeune Suisse</i> directed by
Mazzini. On his return to Baden in 1840 he edited the <i>Landtagszeitung</i>
at Carlsruhe, and in 1842 he entered the estates for the
town of Constance. He became one of the opposition leaders
and in 1847 helped to found the <i>Deutsche Zeitung</i>, a paper
which eventually did much to further the cause of German
unity. He took part in the preliminary parliament and in
the assembly of Frankfort in 1848-1849, where he supported
the policy of H. W. A. von Gagern, and after the refusal of
Frederick William IV. to accept the imperial crown he still
worked for the cause of unity. He was made finance minister in
Baden in May 1849, but was dismissed after a few days of office.
He then applied his financial knowledge to banking business in
Cologne, Berlin, Gotha and Leipzig. He was recalled to Baden
in 1862, and in 1864 became president of the new ministry
of commerce. He sought to bring Baden institutions into
line with those of northern Germany with a view to ultimate
union, and when in 1866 Baden took sides with Austria against
Prussia he sent in his resignation. After the war he became
president of a new cabinet, but he did not live to see the realization
of the policy for which he had striven. He died at
Carlsruhe on the 3rd of February 1868.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATILDA<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> (1102-1164), queen of England and empress,
daughter of Henry I. of England, by Matilda, his first wife,
was born in 1102. In 1109 she was betrothed to the emperor-elect,
Henry V., and was sent to Germany, but the marriage
was delayed till 1114. Her husband died after eleven years
of wedlock, leaving her childless; and, since both her brothers
were now dead, she was recalled to her father&rsquo;s court in order
that she might be recognized as his successor in England and
Normandy. The Great Council of England did homage to her
under considerable pressure. Their reluctance to acknowledge
a female sovereign was increased when Henry gave her in
marriage to Geoffrey Plantagenet, the heir of Anjou and
Maine (1129); nor was it removed by the birth of the future
Henry II. in 1133. On the old king&rsquo;s death both England
and Normandy accepted his nephew, Stephen, of Mortain and
Boulogne. Matilda and her husband were in Anjou at the
time. They wasted the next few years in the attempt to win
Normandy; but Earl Robert of Gloucester, the half-brother
of the empress, at length induced her to visit England and
raise her standard in the western shires, where his influence
was supreme. Though on her first landing Matilda only escaped
capture through the misplaced chivalry of her opponent, she
soon turned the tables upon him with the help of the Church
and the barons of the west. Stephen was defeated and captured
at Lincoln (1141); the empress was acclaimed lady or queen of
England (she used both titles indifferently) and crowned
at London. But the arrogance which she displayed in her
prosperity alienated the Londoners and the papal legate,
Bishop Henry of Winchester. Routed at the siege of Winchester,
she was compelled to release Stephen in exchange for Earl
Robert, and thenceforward her cause steadily declined in
England. In 1148, having lost by the earl&rsquo;s death her principal
supporter, she retired to Normandy, of which her husband
had in the meantime gained possession. Henceforward she
remained in the background, leaving her eldest son Henry
to pursue the struggle with Stephen. She outlived Henry&rsquo;s
coronation by ten years; her husband had died in 1151. As
queen-mother she played the part of a mediator between her
sons and political parties. Age mellowed her temper, and she
turned more and more from secular ambitions to charity and
religious works. She died on the 30th of January 1164.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATILDA<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> (1046-1115), countess or margravine of Tuscany,
popularly known as the Great Countess, was descended from
a noble Lombard family. Her great-grandfather, Athone of
Canossa, had been made count of Modena and Reggio by the
emperor Otto I., and her grandfather had, in addition, acquired
Mantua, Ferrara and Brescia. Her own father, Boniface II.,
the Pious, secured Tuscany, the duchy of Spoleto, the county of
Parma, and probably that of Cremona; and was loyal to the
emperor until Henry plotted against him. Through the murder
of Count Boniface in 1052 and the death of her older brother
and sister three years later, Matilda was left, at the age of
nine, sole heiress to the richest estate in Italy. She received
an excellent education under the care of her mother, Beatrice
of Bar, the daughter of Frederick of Lorraine and aunt of
Henry III., who, after a brief detention in Germany by the
emperor, married Godfrey IV. of Lorraine, brother of Pope
Stephen IX. (1057-1058). Thenceforth Matilda&rsquo;s lot was cast
against the emperor in the great struggle over investiture,
and for over thirty years she maintained the cause of the
successive pontiffs, Gregory VII., Victor III., Urban II.,
Paschal II., with varying fortune, but with undaunted resolution.
She aided the pope against the Normans in 1074, and
in 1075 attended the synod at which Guibert was condemned
and deprived of the archbishopric of Ravenna. Her hereditary
fief of Canossa was the scene (Jan. 28, 1077) of the
celebrated penance of Henry IV. before Gregory VII. She
provided an asylum for Henry&rsquo;s second wife, Praxides, and
urged his son Conrad to revolt against his father. In the
course of the protracted struggle her villages were plundered,
her fortresses demolished, and Pisa and Lucca temporarily lost,
but she remained steadfast in her allegiance, and, before her
death, had, by means of a league of Lombard cities which she
formed, recovered all her possessions. The donation of her
estates to the Holy See, originally made in 1077 and renewed
on the 17th of November 1102, though never fully consummated
on account of imperial opposition, constituted the greater part
of the temporal dominion of the papacy. Matilda was twice
married, first to Godfrey V. of Lorraine, surnamed the Humpbacked,
who was the son of her step-father and was murdered
on the 26th of February 1076; and secondly to the 17-year-old
Welf V. of Bavaria, from whom she finally separated in 1095&mdash;both
marriages of policy, which counted for little in her life.
Matilda was an eager student: she spoke Italian, French and
German fluently, and wrote many Latin letters; she collected
a considerable library; she supervised an edition of the Pandects
of Justinian; and Anselm of Canterbury sent her his <i>Meditations</i>.
She combined her devotion to the papacy and her learning with
very deep personal piety. She died after a long illness at
Bodeno, near Modena, on the 24th of July 1115, and was buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page889" id="page889"></a>889</span>
in the Benedictine church at Polirone, whence her remains
were taken to Rome by order of Urban VIII. in 1635 and
interred in St Peter&rsquo;s.</p>

of Matlock, the commercial and manufacturing district of
Matlock Bridge, and the fashionable health resorts of Matlock
Bath and Matlock Bank. The town possesses cotton, corn and
paper mills, while in the vicinity there are stone-quarries
and lead mines. A peculiar local industry is the manufacture
of so-called &ldquo;petrified&rdquo; birds&rsquo; nests, plants, and other objects.
These are steeped in water from the mineral springs until they
become encrusted with a calcareous deposit which gives them
the appearance of fossils. Ornaments fashioned out of spar

century. They were not known to the Romans, although
lead-mining was carried on extensively in the district in the
1st and 2nd centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span> The mean temperature of the

<p><span class="bold">MATOS FRAGOSO, JUAN DE<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> (1614?-1689), Spanish dramatist,
of Portuguese descent, was born about 1614 at Alsito
(Alemtejo). After taking his degree in law at the university
of Evora, he proceeded to Madrid, where he made acquaintance
with Perez de Montalbán, and thus obtained an introduction
to the stage. He quickly displayed great cleverness in hitting
the public taste, and many contemporaries of superior talent
eagerly sought his aid as a collaborator. The earliest of his
printed plays is <i>La Defensa de la fé y principe prodigioso</i> (1651),
and twelve more pieces were published in 1658. But though
his popularity continued long after his death (January 4, 1689),
Matos Fragoso&rsquo;s dramas do not stand the test of reading.
His emphatic preciosity and sophistical insistence on the &ldquo;point
of honour&rdquo; are tedious and unconvincing; in <i>La Venganza
en el despeño</i>, in <i>Á lo que obliga un agravio</i>, and in other plays,
he merely recasts, very adroitly, works by Lope de Vega.</p>

is frequently used for this purpose. The word is possibly
identical with an old name &ldquo;matrass&rdquo; (Fr. <i>materas</i>, <i>matelas</i>)
for the bolt or quarrel of a cross-bow. If so, some identity
of shape is the reason for the application of the word; &ldquo;bolt-head&rdquo;

of descent and inheritance. Matriarchate is assumed on this
theory to have been universal in prehistoric times. The prominent
position then naturally assigned women did not, however,
imply any personal power, since they were in the position of
mere chattels: it simply constituted them the sole relatives
of their children and the only centre of any such family life
as existed. The custom of tracing descent through the female
is still observed among certain savage tribes. In Fiji father
and son are not regarded as relatives. Among the Bechuanas
the chieftainship passes to a brother, not to a son. In Senegal,
Loango, Congo and Guinea, relationship is traced through the
female. Among the Tuareg Berbers a child takes rank, freeman&rsquo;s
or slave&rsquo;s, from its mother.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATRIMONY<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (Lat. <i>matrimonium</i>, marriage, which is the
ordinary English sense), a game at cards played with a full
whist pack upon a table divided into three compartments
labelled &ldquo;Matrimony,&rdquo; &ldquo;Intrigue&rdquo; and &ldquo;Confederacy,&rdquo; and
two smaller spaces, &ldquo;Pair&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best.&rdquo; These names indicate
combinations of two cards, any king and queen being
&ldquo;Matrimony,&rdquo; any queen and knave &ldquo;Intrigue,&rdquo; any king
and knave &ldquo;Confederacy&rdquo;; while any two cards of the same
denomination form a &ldquo;Pair&rdquo; and the diamond ace is &ldquo;Best.&rdquo;
The dealer distributes a number of counters, to which an agreed
value has been given, upon the compartments, and the other
players do likewise. The dealer then gives one card to each
player, face down, and a second, face up. If any turned-up
card is the diamond ace, the player holding it takes everything
on the space and the deal passes. If not turned, the diamond
ace has only the value of the other three aces. If it is not
turned, the players, beginning with the eldest hand, expose
their second cards, and the resulting combinations, if among
the five successful ones, win the counters of the corresponding
spaces. If the counters on a space are not won, they remain
until the next deal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATRIX,<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> a word of somewhat wide application, chiefly
used in the sense of a bed or enclosing mass in which something
is shaped or formed (Late Lat. <i>matrix</i>, womb; in classical
Latin <i>matrix</i> was only applied to an animal kept for breeding).
Matrix is thus used of a mould of metal or other substance
in which a design or pattern is made in intaglio, and from
which an impression in relief is taken. In die-sinking and
coining, the matrix is the hardened steel mould from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page890" id="page890"></a>890</span>
the die-punches are taken. The term &ldquo;seal&rdquo; should strictly
he applied to the impression only on wax of the design of the
matrix, but is often used both of the matrix and of the impression
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seals</a></span>). In mineralogy, the matrix is the mass in
which a crystal mineral or fossil is embedded. In mathematics,
the name &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; is used of an arrangement of numbers or
symbols in a rectangular or square figure. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Algebraic
Forms</a></span>.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In med. Latin <i>matrix</i> and the diminutive <i>matricula</i> had the
meaning of a roll or register, particularly one containing the names
of the members of an institution, as of the clergy belonging to a
cathedral, collegiate or other church, or of the members of a university.
From this use is derived &ldquo;matriculation,&rdquo; the admission to
membership of a university, also the name of the examination for
such admission. <i>Matricula</i> was also the name of the contributions
in men and money made by the various states of the Holy
Roman Empire, and in the modern German Empire the contributions
made by the federal states to the imperial finances are
called <i>Matrikularbeiträge</i>, matricular contributions. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Germany</a></span>:
<i>Finance</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATROSS,<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> the name (now obsolete) for a soldier of artillery,
who ranked next below a gunner. The duty of a matross was
to assist the gunners in loading, firing and sponging the guns.
They were provided with firelocks, and marched with the store-wagons,
acting as guards. In the American army a matross
ranked as a private of artillery. The word is probably derived
from Fr. <i>matelot</i>, a sailor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATSUKATA,<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquis</span> (1835-&emsp;&emsp;), Japanese statesman,
was born at Kagoshima in 1835, being a son of a <i>samurai</i> of
the Satsuma clan. On the completion of the feudal revolution
of 1868 he was appointed governor of the province of Tosa,
and having served six years in this office, was transferred to
T&#333;ky&#333; as assistant minister of finance. As representative of
Japan at the Paris Exhibition of 1878, he took the opportunity
afforded by his mission to study the financial systems of the
great European powers. On his return home, he held for a
short time in 1880 the portfolio of home affairs, and was in
1881 appointed minister of finance. The condition of the
currency of Japan was at that time deplorable, and national
bankruptcy threatened. The coinage had not only been
seriously debased during the closing years of the Tokugawa
régime, but large quantities of paper currency had been issued
and circulated, both by many of the feudal lords, and by the
central government itself, as a temporary expedient for filling
an impoverished exchequer. In 1878 depreciation had set in,
and the inconvertible paper had by the close of 1881 grown to
such an extent that it was then at a discount of 80% as compared
with silver. Matsukata showed the government the
danger of the situation, and urged that the issue of further
paper currency should be stopped at once, the expenses of
administration curtailed, and the resulting surplus of revenue
used in the redemption of the paper currency and in the creation
of a specie reserve. These proposals were acted upon: the
Bank of Japan was established, and the right of issuing convertible
notes given to it; and within three years of the initiation
of these financial reforms, the paper currency, largely
reduced in quantity, was restored to its full par value with
silver, and the currency as a whole placed on a solvent basis.
From this time forward Japan&rsquo;s commercial and military
advancement continued to make uninterrupted progress.
But <i>pari passu</i> with the extraordinary impetus given to its
trade by the successful conclusion of the war with China, the
national expenditure enormously increased, rising within a
few years from 80 to 250 million yen. The task of providing
for this expenditure fell entirely on Matsukata, who had to
face strong opposition on the part of the diet. But he distributed
the increased taxation so equally, and chose its subjects
so wisely, that the ordinary administrative expenditure and
the interest on the national debt were fully provided for, while
the extraordinary expenditure for military purposes was met
from the Chinese indemnity. As far back as 1878 Matsukata
perceived the advantages of a gold standard, but it was not
until 1897 that his scheme could be realized. In this year
the bill authorizing it was under his auspices submitted to the
diet and passed; and with this financial achievement Matsukata
saw the fulfilment of his ideas of financial reform, which were
conceived during his first visit to Europe. Matsukata, who
in 1884 was created Count, twice held the office of prime minister
(1891-1892, 1896-1898), and during both his administrations
he combined the portfolio of finance with the premiership;
from October 1898 to October 1900 he was minister of finance
only. His name in Japanese history is indissolubly connected
with the financial progress of his country at the end of the
19th century. In 1902 he visited England and America,
and he was created G.C.M.G., and given the Oxford degree
of D.C.L. In September 1907 he was advanced to the rank of
Marquis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATSYS<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Massys</span> or <span class="sc">Metzys</span>), <span class="bold">QUINTIN</span> (1466-1530),
Flemish artist, was born at Louvain, where he first learned
a mechanical art. During the greater part of the 15th century
the centres in which the painters of the Low Countries most
congregated were Bruges, Ghent and Brussels. Towards the
close of the same period Louvain took a prominent part in
giving employment to workmen of every craft. It was not
till the opening of the 16th century that Antwerp usurped
the lead which it afterwards maintained against Bruges and
Ghent, Brussels, Mechlin and Louvain. Quintin Matsys
was one of the first men of any note who gave repute to the
gild of Antwerp. A legend relates how the smith of Louvain
was induced by affection for the daughter of an artist to change
his trade and acquire proficiency in painting. A less poetic
but perhaps more real version of the story tells that Quintin
had a brother with whom he was brought up by his father Josse
Matsys, a smith, who held the lucrative offices of clockmaker
and architect to the municipality of Louvain. It came to be
a question which of the sons should follow the paternal business,
and which carve out a new profession for himself. Josse the
son elected to succeed his father, and Quintin then gave himself
to the study of painting. We are not told expressly by whom
Quintin was taught, but his style seems necessarily derived
from the lessons of Dierick Bouts, who took to Louvain the
mixed art of Memlinc and Van der Weyden. When he settled
at Antwerp, at the age of twenty-five, he probably had a style
with an impress of its own, which certainly contributed most importantly
to the revival of Flemish art on the lines of Van Eyck
and Van der Weyden. What particularly characterizes Quintin
Matsys is the strong religious feeling which he inherited from
earlier schools. But that again was permeated by realism which
frequently degenerated into the grotesque. Nor would it be
too much to say that the facial peculiarities of the boors of
Van Steen or Ostade have their counterparts in the pictures of
Matsys, who was not, however, trained to use them in the
same homely way. From Van der Weyden&rsquo;s example we may
trace the dryness of outline and shadeless modelling and the
pitiless finish even of trivial detail, from the Van Eycks and
Memlinc through Dierick Bouts the superior glow and richness
of transparent pigments, which mark the pictures of Matsys.
The date of his retirement from Louvain is 1491, when he
became a master in the gild of painters at Antwerp. His most
celebrated picture is that which he executed in 1508 for the
joiners&rsquo; company in the cathedral of his adopted city. Next
in importance to that is the Marys of Scripture round the
Virgin and Child, which was ordered for a chapel in the cathedral
of Louvain. Both altar-pieces are now in public museums,
one at Antwerp, the other at Brussels. They display great
earnestness in expression, great minuteness of finish, and a
general absence of effect by light or shade. As in early Flemish
pictures, so in those of Matsys, superfluous care is lavished
on jewelry, edgings and ornament. To the great defect of
want of atmosphere such faults may be added as affectation,
the result of excessive straining after tenderness in women,
or common gesture and grimace suggested by a wish to render
pictorially the brutality of gaolers and executioners. Yet
in every instance an effort is manifest to develop and express
individual character. This tendency in Matsys is chiefly
illustrated in his pictures of male and female market bankers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page891" id="page891"></a>891</span>
(Louvre and Windsor), in which an attempt is made to display
concentrated cupidity and avarice. The other tendency to
excessive emphasis of tenderness may be seen in two replicas
of the &ldquo;Virgin and Child&rdquo; at Berlin and Amsterdam, where the
ecstatic kiss of the mother is quite unreal. But in these examples
there is a remarkable glow of colour which makes up for many
defects. Expression of despair is strongly exaggerated in a
Lucretia at the museum of Vienna. On the whole the best
pictures of Matsys are the quietest; his &ldquo;Virgin and Christ&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mater Dolorosa&rdquo; (London and Antwerp)
display as much serenity and dignity as seems consistent with
the master&rsquo;s art. He had considerable skill as a portrait
painter. Egidius at Longford, which drew from Sir Thomas
More a eulogy in Latin verse, is but one of a numerous class,
to which we may add the portrait of Maximilian of Austria
in the gallery of Amsterdam. Matsys in this branch of practice
was much under the influence of his contemporaries Lucas
of Leiden and Mabuse. His tendency to polish and smoothness
excluded to some extent the subtlety of modulation remarkable
in Holbein and Dürer. There is reason to think that he was
well acquainted with both these German masters. He probably
met Holbein more than once on his way to England. He
saw Dürer at Antwerp in 1520. Quintin died at Antwerp
in 1530. The puritan feeling which slumbered in him was
fatal to some of his relatives. His sister Catherine and her
husband suffered at Louvain in 1543 for the then capital offence
of reading the Bible, he being decapitated, she buried alive
in the square fronting the cathedral.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Quintin&rsquo;s son, Jan Matsys, inherited the art but not the skill of
his parent. The earliest of his works, a &ldquo;St Jerome,&rdquo; dated 1537, in
the gallery of Vienna, the latest, a &ldquo;Healing of Tobias,&rdquo; of 1564, in
the museum of Antwerp, are sufficient evidence of his tendency to
substitute imitation for original thought.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MATTEAWAN,<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> a village of Fishkill township, Dutchess
county, New York, U.S.A., on the eastern bank of the Hudson
river, opposite Newburgh and 15 m. S. of Poughkeepsie. Pop.
(1890), 4278; (1900), 5807 (1044 foreign-born); (1905, state
census), 5584; (1910), 6727. The village is served by the Central
New England railway, and is the seat of the Matteawan state
hospital for the criminal insane, the Highland hospital, and the
Sargeant industrial school. The Teller House dates back to
the beginning of the 18th century. Near Matteawan is Beacon
Hill, the highest of the highlands, which has an electric railway
to its summit. There are manufactures of hats, rubber goods,
machinery (notably &ldquo;fuel-economizers&rdquo;), &amp;c., water-power
being furnished by Fishkill Creek. The village owns its
waterworks, the supply for which is derived from Beacon
Hill. Matteawan was incorporated as a village in 1886.</p>
